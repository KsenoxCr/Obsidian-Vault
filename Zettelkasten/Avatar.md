### Create a Single Imaginary Person That Represents The Whole Target Market

Give him/her:
	-Name
	-Face
	-Age
	-background / mini life history
	-Daily in the life
	-Dreams/Fears
	-Social life
	...

By creating an avatar, the reader feels like you are writing directly to him
--> Increases Impact

You will feel much more empathy when writing to one person only so you can come up with more intriguing and button pushing sentences. 

Don't be too autistic about the narrowing down of the message. So get too specific but get specific enough so that there is relatability and pretty much everyone in the target market can relate to the core issues and beliefs .
