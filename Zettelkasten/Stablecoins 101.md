## **Goal of stablecoins**

A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency which has its value pegged to another currency. 

**BTC** and **ETH** with the occasional 10-20% of daily fluctuations can't be just yet a well functioning store of value. 

The volatility is great for speculation but it slows down adoption. This volatility is especially unacceptable for large whales.

This is where stablecoins come in. Stablecoin prices are pegged to another stable asset like the US dollar. You can be exposed to crypto by basically holding US dollar. 

Stablecoins like other cryptocurrencies are also very easy to transfer.



### **Reasons to hold stablecoins**

**- They lower the volatility in a portfolio.** 

**- They help you preserve your portfolio from losing too much money and you can immediately access them if you wanna buy in.** 

**- You can hold fiat on-chain and no one knows about it or can take it from you.

**- Using decentralized applications with dollar pegged assets**


### **Designing stablecoins**

**You can't just decide that something is worth $1, but that's what stable coins actually want to achieve.** 

Stablecoins are always pegged to a price instead of being priced by supply and demand. To achieve this they have to be properly designed and maintained.

There are a few ways to achieve this. All of the current designs have their pros and cons. There are some desirable traits of the perfect stablecoin but still no stablecoin has all of them: 

**- Price stable (collateralized)**
**- Decentralized**
**- Capital Efficient**



## **Fiat-backed stable coins**


This is the most important type for most people. 

These are backed by some kind of currency like the US dollar. Behind every coin there is a fiat equivalent locked up somewhere.

They are 100% collateralized and capital efficient as well. They are centralized though. Companies and governments can freeze the funds. 

As of today they are still the safest way to be exposed to crypto. 

**$USDC, $USDT, $BUSD** are the largest ones on the market. These are the ones that you should use.
