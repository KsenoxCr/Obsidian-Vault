Tools for your copywriting mental toolbox

### 1. Make Info more specific 

-Going from abstract --> specific and vivid

Abstract: "Hey, I've got ideas to make your page convert better"

Specific: "Hey, I've got 6 major web design tweaks to your CTA to increase your convertion rate"

### 2. Tell what the teased thing is NOT

Not Statements:

"Hey, I've got 6 web design tweats to help you improve your convertion rate. And no, its not changing colors and making the buttons bigger"

### 3. Tap into things they are already curious about

Most people are by nature curious about **high status figures** like billionaires, historical figures like cleopatra or napoleon, Idol Musicians

### 4. Paradoxes, unexplainable things

Example: Burning Bush, Moses

-contradictions you havent been able to reconcile --> creates curiosity

"You can learn a language easily as kid, but so hard when your an adult"

= unexplainable phenomena that if understand can give you edge in learning

### 5. Conflict & Drama

Company fighting over other company. Argument between celebrities...

You want to know... WHY?

You think there must be a good reason behind the fighting and it can be benefitial to know this reason. 

### 6. Idea of Being in the Group that Knows

Reader = Don't know X, Y and Z = Don't have the dream life

Group of people = Know X, Y and Z = have reader's dream life

teasing reader to take action to be part of the group **that knows**

"Hey, look

The top 3 brands in this area are using a very specific social media formula to allow them to be the first profile to show when searching "insert niche" on Instagram

I will show you what it is"
