### **PoS Staking vs staking**

When it comes to staking it can mean two things.

1. PoS (proof of staking) for Ethereum or other PoS blockhains

2. Locking your coins in a product's smart contract

PoS and simple staking have many similarities especially when it comes to liquid staking which sits in the middle.

### Staking (PoS)

Your coins earns rewards while staked because the blockchain puts them to work. Cryptocurrencies that allow staking use the PoS (Proof-of-Stake) consensus mechanism.

Staking serves a similar function like mining which is a way to make sure that all transactions are verified and secured. Your coins will be part of this process if you choose to stake it.


### Liquid Staking (PoS)

Liquid staking products like Lido are protocols for $ETH staking. Users get liquid staking derivatives in exchange for staking $ETH, which represents their claim on the given stake pool and its yield.

When you deposit ETH on Lido, you'll receive stETH. A staking pool, with a tokenized version of your staked ETH ($stETH).

You can stake 1 $ETH and you get 1 $stETH in return. The protocol takes care of PoS staking in the background.

The protocol chooses a validator from a set of node operators. You earn staking rewards with your $ETH and your $stETH balance increases thanks to the staking rewards.



After the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade is deployed staked $ETH can be “unstaked” and the underlying $ETH can be redeemed. Since liquid staking protocols make your staked $ETH liquid you can already trade your $stETH against $ETH with the help of liquidity pools.

The rate depends on the state of the pool. Most of the time the liquid $stETH : $ETH trading ratio is 1, but in June 2022 it actually depegged thanks to some forced $stETH selling as many big players became insolvent.

### Advantages of liquid staking (PoS)

- Staking $ETH without the need of becoming a validator
- Get yields on the staked $ETH
- Instant trading if needed (rate depends on market conditions)
- Using the staked $ETH with other DeFi protocols (lending, providing liquidity, etc)

Getting a derivative token for staking ($stETH) opens up many opportunities for investors. You will see this will be the case for staking on simpler dApps as well.

## **Staking**

Staking is a form of locking your coins in exchange for rewards. It usually happens in a decentralized way, but some of the CEX’s also allow you to stake your coins.
‎
When you stake your coins you will get confirmation in the form of staked tokens. If you for example stake $SPELL you will get $sSPELL (staked $SPELL) as a receipt which you will see showing up in your wallet. To get back your $SPELL you will have to unstake your $sSPELL.

Sometimes you have to lock your coins for a longer period of time. Don't do that as the DeFi space changes quickly and your tokens might not be worth anything a year from now.


### Staking rewards

The rewards come in several forms. The main ones are voting rights, liquidity mining programs, or revenue share.
‎
Since you get rewards after your staked tokens they are also called interest-bearing tokens. Sometimes you can sell those on secondary markets as well. Even better if you can use your staked tokens as collateral/liquidity for other projects.

You can stake for instance your $SUSHI and get $xSUSHI (staked $SUSHI) for it, then put that into another protocol as collateral and earn more rewards.

Sometimes you have to lock your coins for a longer period of time to earn yield. Don't do that as the DeFi space changes quickly and your tokens won't be worth anything a year from now.

### **APR Calculations**

Often people use APY (annual percentage yield) and APR (annual percentage rate) interchangeably which is incorrect. Even projects mix it up, so it’s better if you always double-check what the numbers actually mean.
‎
APR stands for the yield that you get yearly based on your initial investment without compound. Let's say you stake 1 ETH for 365% APR.
‎
(1 + 3.65)^1 = 4.65
‎
After a year you will make 3.65 ETH profit and will be able to take out 4.65 ETH assuming your yield gets paid in ETH and the yield stays constant during the year.‎


### **APY Calculations**

![[Pasted image 20240218153836.png]]

APY stands for compounded yield. It means the project has a mechanism in the smart contract to auto-compound your yields. If you take the previous example and your yield is auto-compounding once a day for a year then you will get more money. Let’s exclude the gas fees for the following calculation.
‎
365% APR means 1% growth daily which is compounding once a day.
‎
(1 + 0.01)^365 = 37.78
‎
So you can take out 37.78 ETH (36.78 ETH profit) after a year which translates to 3678% APY.


### **Staking Calculations**

Staking yields tend to fluctuate over time. If the staking feature is based on initial staking program to acquire new users then you can expect the yield to decrease quickly. 

If staking is a way of revenue distribution without any extra boost, the APR could go up if the project performs well. 


3,678% APY is exceptionally high. It’s very important for you to understand what the source of that money is.
‎
Let’s do a calculation now from APY to APR. There is a project from 2021 called $TIME ($OHM fork on Avalanche chain) where the staking APY was around 66,700% at some point with compounding every 6 hours. Let’s see what the APR is in this case.
‎
Over the year it will compound 4 x 365 = 1,460 times.
‎
66,700% is the profit which means if you have 1 TIME to start with, you will have 1 + 667 = 668 TIME in the end.
‎
(1 + x)^1460 = 668
‎
x = 0.0044649 which translates to 0.44649% every 6 hours
