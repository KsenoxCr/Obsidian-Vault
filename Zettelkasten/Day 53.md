9/10. Really good day. Got side tracker few times used my time pretty well. again spend little too much time on the phone and morning side of the day was problem to keep up the pace of work as im concious of long day ahead. Lots of tabs and shit on table were distracting. Also sitting too long and didnt meditate with would have been net profit in terms of productivity and thing done. 

Use Timers For G Work Sessions (no time to worry that way)
