8/10

Coded kirjasto-ohjelma pretty religiously and learned new concepts. 

Made a useless video of my vr experience that took almost an hour.
Watches/listened to andrew between work sessions which streched the breaks.


Again Went to sleep too late and wasted time talking to mom. Its okay and even neccessary to talk but it needs to be done after all work is done. And when its work related it needs to stay like in those topics.


Lessons learned:

-Dont do backtests when not sharp enough. Its just a waste of time and can even make things worse. 

Watch daily tasklist everytime you stop/finish a task and prioritize and do tasks in importance order. Don't ever try to do two things at a time and have tens of tabs open. It just makes it hard to focus and perform well in the moment.

Every time before you speak to someone, think about what you want from that conversation. That way you dont waste time chatting shit. Its fine for few words but without purpose it always takes too long.

I have ETH holdings and am about to Long eth using AAVE and would like your approval if I have the lending protocols correcting before diving deep and doing any big moves.

So I have $4,600 in ETH right now and was planning to hold them throughout the bull run anyway so...

If I supply 1,46 ETH to loan 1900 usdt to buy 0.6 ETH so my collaterals liquidation price would be $1530 for one ETH

and I expect the price to go atleast ATH 

ETH current price = $3,150

ETH ATH = $4,700

so I would get:

Supply + Loan =  1,46 * $4,700 + ($4,700 - $3,150) = $8412 (not including lending yield and borrowing interest rate)

I will ofc calculate these more indept and also calculate the possible losses if you think I have understood this correctly and that profit sounds right.
