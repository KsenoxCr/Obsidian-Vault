## You Have To Understand Tokenomics



### How To Check How Big a Project Is

- **Market Gap**
- **Fully Diluted Valuation**
- **Initial Supply**, (important first few days)
- **Circulating Supply**
- **Locking or Not**
- **Total Supply**
- **Project's Documentation**

#### Price Itself Is Not Important

### But Price * Circulating Supply = Market Cap, Is!


Check how quickly token inflates

Optimus is inflating really quickly, not good

Don't want to see this steep of a infation curve

Bad = circulating supply low compared to max supply + max inflation/supply schedule timeline is not long

### **Tokens and Coins**

These terms are used interchangeably which is not totally correct.

Coin is a cryptocurrency asset. Coins are not intended to serve as utility unlike crypto tokens. It is used as a store of value or medium of exchange. To put it another way the main difference between these two comes down to utility.

There are things you can do with tokens and not with coins. On the other hand, some marketplaces will accept coins and not tokens.
‎
The difference is subtle, so it will be used interchangeably from now on to go with the convention.

### Price doesn't mean anything by itself

The price of a coin doesn’t mean anything without knowing the number of coins. Having 1 coin of X at price $10 represents the same value as 10 coin X at price $1.

Think of some foreign currencies. **1 EUR is not the same as 1 CHF.** As of this writing if you express that in dollars 1 EUR is worth 1.13 USD and 1 CHF is worth 1.08 USD.

What actually matters is the **price multiplied by the number of coins which represents the valuations of the particular project or company.** To define the number of coins we will have to look at a few more definitions first.

**Maximum supply**

The maximum number of coins that can be ever in existence. First it gets set when the token contract is deployed on chain. It’s important to cap the supply otherwise the token value could get inflated. On top of that there are ways to take some of the coins out of circulation forever which can make the token deflationary and reduce the maximum supply.

**Total supply**

The total supply is the number of tokens that currently exists and are either in circulation or locked. It is the sum of coins that has already been mined/issued minus the total of coins that were burned.

**Circulating supply**

The circulating supply is number of coins that are available for trading in the different markets. It does not include the coins that are locked up or being held in reserve.

**Initial supply** 

The number of coins that make it in circulation when the token contract is deployed. 

**Token emission** 

It is the a schedule and methods of issuing new tokens into circulation. This includes when tokens will be issued for the team/VC’s/early adopters. 

**Burn** 

This a way to reduce the token supply by removing it from circulation. The use case here is to make a token more valuable by making it more scarce. 

**Mint**

Don’t confuse this with minting an NFT. In this case this is just the opposite of burning. It means the increase of number of tokens in circulation.

**Lock/unlock**

Coins can get locked or unlocked. In general it is a mechanism to prevent people from selling that particular coin in exchange for some kind of rewards.

**Market Cap (MC)**

Market cap applies to other markets as well not only to crypto. It represents the current market value of a particular token or project.

It’s calculated by multiplying the price of the token with the circulating supply.

If token A is worth $1 and the circulating supply is 100,000,000 then the MC is $100,000,000.

If token B is worth $2 and the circulating supply is 20,000,000 then the MC is $40,000,000.

The market value of token A is higher although its price is lower compared to token B.


**Fully diluted valuation (FDV)**
‎
The term "diluted market cap" comes from the stock market. It represents a company's valuation when all stock options are exercised and all securities are converted to stock.
‎
It’s calculated by multiplying the price of the token with the maximum supply.
‎
Let’s reuse token A and B from the previous example.
‎
If token A’s total supply is 200,000,000 then the FDV is $200,000,000.
‎
If token B’s total supply is 100,000,000 then the FDV is $200,000,000 for token B as well.

The total supply of $BTC is 21,000,000 (For $BTC max supply is also 21,000,000). If the current $BTC price is $30,000 then the FDV of $BTC is $630,000,000,000.


### **Supply and demand**

If something is scare that's more valuable. This is why for instance gold is worth a lot. It's scarce in nature. Also, this is the same why sand is worth nothing. It's everywhere in nature. This is basic supply-demand.

**More Scarce** --> **More Valuable**

**More abundant** --> **Less Valuable**

The same rules apply for other things in life as well including cryptocurrencies.

If new coins get minted/emissioned then the valuation gets diluted. This is inflation. The price has to go down for valuation to stay the same.

**Coins Minted** --> **Price Goes Down**

If coins get burned then that means the remaining coins will be worth more, so the price will have to go up for the valuation to be the same.

**Coins Burned** --> **Price Goes Up**


### **Basic rules**

You need practical experience to get good at this but here is a few things to consider:

- If emission is high then expect sell pressure on the coin.

- If there is an unlock where let's say 20% of the coins will be released on the market then expect sell pressure on the coin.

- When FDV is much higher than MC then expect high emission over the long run as well.

- Always compare FDV and MC with a timeline and emission schedule considered.

- If there is a significant burn event then expect buy pressure on the coin.

- Low and stable emission is a good sign. Projects have to find a balance to emit enough tokens to reward their early users but they shouldn't emit too much because that will dilute the project.

- If coins get locked that causes buy pressure on the coin.

### **Emission schedules**

![[Pasted image 20240209003334.png]]

All projects should have emission schedules. You can always check the schedule and see the emission rules over time.

You can also see the unlock dates as well that can be super crucial.

Before buying into any small or mid cap tokens you should always take a look at this.

If tokenomics is trash then always double check if it's a good idea to buy that token.
