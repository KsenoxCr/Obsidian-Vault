Oscullator that measures the strength, in relative terms, of a move

- RSI -> Measure strength and weakness in trends
- Most relevant and useful on higher timeframes
- Drawn on candle closes only

- Start on HTF then go lower
- Always keep HTF in mind when executing based on LTF

### Bearish divergence:

Relative strength went down + price went up = divergence = first sign of upcoming trend shift
### Bullish divergence:

- Daily divergences happen relatively infrequently (about once a month)

## Go even lower (4H) for getting entries for trades  

#### You dont have to exit when price hits 70/30

- Price will often continue higher than 70 because that is how you get a divergence

### For scalping: even lower (i.e 5M)

- Bearish divergence is usually more reliable 

because most of people in crypto are long and when its going down, there are often forced liquidation cascades that continue going down even when LTF RSI shows bullish divergence:
