Market usually rallies up fast before pulling back signicantly (40-60%)

This is only applicable on the first rally off the bear market lows

It needs to have a clear bottom, atleast "W" pattern but better to zig zag side ways for longer

It cant just be a low that preseeds the pump like in the pic below:

- The deeper the pullback (closer to 60%), the better

### Look at the market as a whole

- If some random coin does make a 40-60% pullback but the rest of the market hasnt moved from the lows = not a high probability setup

- Here Celestia only did 40% but other coins like pepe, solana did 50-60%
- When new coins do this, take like 20 major alts from different sectors and look if they have done the same move (40-60%)

#### This setup happens only once at the start of a bull market

### Even shitcoins like luna can do this

- This methods idea is get you in after the first leg, earliest time to enter a confirmed trend
- This way you get a non-crowded trade
- Its really easy to talk yourself out of this setup
- You dont fomo into to the green candles, you are looking for lower high

#### It's easy to spot patterns in hindsight, hard in real time under pressure

- This pattern is traded by getting in at the accumulation phase
- But its hard to get in before the big move because people are afraid to buy after scary big candles, *you need to get over that fear*

## Setup

1. Price Below resistance
2. Making higher highs and higher lows
3. Wait for 1, 2, 3, 4 to form
4. See price pullback but stay above 50 EMA (or touch it)
5. Enter

Best time to enter when most people are in the bearish mindset

### When everyone is pessimistic and don't want to look at the charts, you look (best time to entry when early)
