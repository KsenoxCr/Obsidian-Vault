Use Timers For G Work Sessions (no time to worry that way)

8.5/10. Good day, got a lot of done but spend too much time on one school assigment by not putting a timer on and just doing the work. Also spend quite much time on phone with mom but thats accectable, but neet to find ways to lower that time a little so its more scarce --> more valuable time. 

Went to sleep at over 3 am which is not good time but its fine when no school. But bad for sleep schedule. 

hardworking but relaxed mindset was on point today!
