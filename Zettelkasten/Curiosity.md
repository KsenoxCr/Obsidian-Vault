## Ability to create and direct Curiosity is one of the best superpower of copywriter

With curiosity, you can trap the reader to "have" to read further to know the answer

(My answer) Curiosity = Urge to know the unknown, learn something new for control and safety/security

#### Curiosity = Close an information gap about something you really care about

Thing that Trigger/Create Curiosity:
	-Success stories
	-bold claims
	-info with missing part (ex. rice + chicken + secret ingredient = double the gainzz as normal meal)
	 -cliffhangers
	 -puzzles
