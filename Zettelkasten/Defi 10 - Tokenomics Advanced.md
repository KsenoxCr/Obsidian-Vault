### Why do we care?

Projects with good tokenomics have a much higher chance of succeeding.
â€Ž
Even the tokens of the best projects with shitty tokenomics are doomed to go down. Best examples are the DeFi 1.0 tokens like LINK or AAVE.
â€Ž
Ponzi projects with good tokenomics can go on for quite a while before collapsing. Look at OHM and its forks.
â€Ž
For the long term itâ€™s better to invest into a quality projects with clever tokenomics. In the short run tokenomics matter much more than the quality of the project.



### What are we looking for?

As investors we simply want the price of the token to go up.
â€Ž
There are many things to be considered but at the end of the day all we want is to sell higher. When we sell we donâ€™t care about the market cap or the emissions.
â€Ž
The same rule applies to other investors. If someone bought a token at a much lower price than you then expect that person to take profits and dump on you.


### Why does price change?

This is simple supply and demand.
â€Ž
On the demand side if more people want it then the price will go up if fewer the price will go down.
â€Ž
On the supply side if there are more tokens available the price will go down if there are fewer tokens available the price will go up.


### Evaluating supply

You have to look at token distribution, emission schedules, unlocks, vesting, and basic tokenomics numbers.
â€Ž
You should be looking for the following:
â€Ž
- The tokens are distributed properly.
-  If the token is inflationary or deflationary.
- Team members and VCâ€™s get the tokens at a rational price and they vest over a longer period of time with small unlocks.
- If this is set up properly there is no big unlock events and VCâ€™s canâ€™t quickly dump on your head.
- If a VC got in at the tenth of the price and unlocks those tokens then of course the VC will sell those tokens.



### Simple supply

![[Pasted image 20240302181939.png]]

$BTC is easy because there arenâ€™t any investor unlocks, no team treasury, no cliffs/vesting or any other complex things.

Most tokens are not that simple though. For Bitcoin we can just look at the Circulating Supply, the Max Supply, and the inflation chart and know where we are, most tokens are more complex than that. 


### **Token distribution**

![[Pasted image 20240302181950.png]]

This should be reasonable and follow current industry norms.

It's always terrible if the team and/or VC's can keep most of the tokens.

Compare several tokens to see the differences.


### Deflationary vs inflationary tokens

![[Pasted image 20240302182023.png]]


Some tokens are deflationary and some tokens are inflationary.

In most cases you will find tokens that inflate quickly in the beginning and then the emission slows down and reaches max supply after a few years.


### Private and public prices

Team members and VCâ€™s should get the tokens at a rational price and they vest over a longer period of time with small unlocks.

VC's usually get in at the fraction of the price compared to retail. If the tokens are not vested/locked then they will dump immediately which will significantly decrease the price.


### Emission schedule

![[Pasted image 20240302182056.png]]

Always look at emission schedules to see how quickly a token gets inflated and when unlocks happen.


### Unlocks

Big unlocks mean huge supply increase which of course leads to price dump.
â€Ž
Liquidity boosting emissions should slow down over time and players should have proper motivation to hold their tokens. If the emission schedule is not well-designed and the token doesnâ€™t have some inherent value the people who earn those tokens will immediately dump it. This is a clear situation of sell pressure on the token and the price will constantly decrease over time. Many of the DeFi 1.0 tokens have this problem.
â€Ž
The protocol should make sure to create a healthy connection between liquidity, market cap, and fully diluted valuation. The FDV shouldnâ€™t be 20 times higher than the MC as the price can get artificially pumped and inflated. Also if the pools are not liquid enough the price is much easier to manipulate and investors canâ€™t buy with big money.
â€Ž
Buyback, burn and mint mechanisms should be implemented correctly. With burn and mint the supply can be changed. If the burn/mint mechanism works well it has a huge positive impact on the projectâ€™s future.


### Airdrops

In most cases airdrops are just a way for teams to make money.

You can make a ton of money on airdrops but you gotta understand the game.

Airdrops can be bullish and bearish at the same time. You also have to be aware of the timeline.



### Evaluating demand

Evaluating demand can be more subjective than supply. What has value is up to interpretation.
â€Ž
Value can come in different forms. **Revenue sharing, governance, and other utility. Memetics, status, lockups, etc are super important to create demand as well**. You have to make sure you know why would be valuable what you buy.

Always think of what the utility of token is.

 ðŸ”¹Does it capture the protocol value?
 ðŸ”¹How much buy power can the utility drive?
 ðŸ”¹Is it quick short term demand only?
â€Ž
Utility is the thing every protocol basically needs to keep up the business in the long run. If they have enough utility/revenue and they share it with token holders then token holders will be properly motivated to keep those tokens instead of dumping it.



### Goal of the token

![[Pasted image 20240302183554.png]]

Is the token for investment? Or is it a token you have to spend? If the latter, then it doesnâ€™t make any sense to hold it in the long run.

The $LINK token for instance is mostly used to pay for Chainlink services (no cash flows or other utilities), so it's for spending not investing.



### Revenue share

One of the best ways to make sure that holders keep the token.

Users have incentives (money) to stay with the project as the tokens usually have to be staked.



### Governance

If you believe in a project and you want to be involved in decisions, then governance is the another utility that could make you invest.

In some cases other DeFi protocols, VC's, or whales might want to have some saying in the future decisions, so they buy up the tokens.


### Lockups

![[Pasted image 20240302183929.png]]

Some projects have clever tokenomics design to increase demand.

One of these things is lockups. People who buy in will be able to stake those tokens for high APR for instance by locking them up. This means those people are not able to sell. So since people are not able to sell this is also decreasing supply.

Lockups are usually a bad idea unless you really wanna hold the token in the long run. Anything can basically happen to any project. If your coins are locked up then you can't sell, so you have to take the loss.



### Memetics

![[Pasted image 20240302184152.png]]

Symbols rule our world and if some of the tokens manage become memes they have a much higher chance of succeeding.

Think of Doge or Shiba. Did they have any inherent value? No. But by now they have become a symbol.

After becoming a symbol/meme a protocol also has much higher chances to create utility as well.



### Protocol specific value

There are also protocol specific ways to create more demand. A good example would be the curve wars. Many projects need deep liquidity to function properly and they can boost their liquidity by increasing rewards in their pools on curve finance. Of course for that they need voting power and they have to buy CRV/CVX. Thatâ€™s a nice buy pressure on CRV/CVX.


### Tricks

![[Pasted image 20240302184547.png]]

Another one that has to be mentioned is tricks to make people believe the coin is cheap. Good famous examples are Doge/Shiba. The token price used to be a small fraction of a dollar.

Many retail people thought it was cheap because of that reason. I know. Itâ€™s sad. But thatâ€™s the world we live in.



### Summary

There are other things as well that can change the token price but those donâ€™t have to be token specific. Tokens can get oversold/overbought based on the market environment and narratives. 

In general you should never buy into tokens that went up a lot already in a very short period of time. Same way if you think you invested money in a protocol that has real value itâ€™s a good idea to keep those tokens if they get oversold a bit for any reason.
â€Ž
Whenever you wanna buy into new protocols always check the tokenomics before buying in.
