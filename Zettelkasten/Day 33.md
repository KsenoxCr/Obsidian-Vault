8/10. Did all my planned tasks. Post office trip turned into grocery store trip as I assumed the package was at the same location as usual. I saw my "loser" friend as I sold him my old stuff. Shouldn't have spend so long chit chatting nonsense. Was able to fight the urges to most bad habits. Didn't do every school assignment bc of poor focus but it was not due to any external things. Mind went wandering many times while doing school work and a lot while doing copy for client mainly because of no timer set and probably fraction of a reason was yesterdays microdose
Smoked microdose of thc for leg day which definitely wasn't good choice but not the most wrong. 

Overall pretty good day and much better than yester day :)

Lessons Learned:
- shouldn't assume things to stay the same as usual.
- Should take breaks to ensure full focus
