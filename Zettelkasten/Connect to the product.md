After showing them what they:
- done wrong
- what they need to do to get what they want

Need to frame the product as the best thing thats gonna help them get there

## Frame the product:

- Efficient, quick, Gets them there faster 
- Is less risky
- avoid costly mistakes 
- Gets them greater results than by themselves
- more enjoyable

You should try to do all 4 of those


The product should never be "magic"

It's gonna realistically and logically help the reader get the from where they are now to where they want to be. 

Need to show them how your product is the BEST vehicle


"Dear friend

Here is your problem, why you are where you are

Here is the solution, the if... then... what you need to do

And here is a product that makes it as quick, riskless, efficient and enjoyable as possible
