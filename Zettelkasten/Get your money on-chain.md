### **On-ramp/off-ramp**

On-ramp means that you buy crypto with fiat money.
Off-ramp means that you sell crypto for fiat money.

You need access to an exchange or other payment infrastructure products (like Moonpay) to on-ramp/off-ramp money.

You send fiat to the exchange then trade it for crypto ($ETH). After on-ramp, you send the coin to your on-chain address that you can access with your non-custodial wallet.

If you want to cash out, send the coins to the exchange from your non-custodial wallet, then trade the coins for fiat money and send it to your bank account.

### **Your setup is location dependent**

The rules are changing quickly in crypto and your setup will be location dependent.

You have to figure out what works in your country for on-ramp/off-ramp.

Once you are on-chain it basically does not matter where you are.


### **When to use a centralized exchange**

- On-ramp/Off-ramp 

- Some coins are only liquid enough or available to trade on centralized exchanges. In this case send your coins to the exchange, then make the trade on the exchange, then send your coins back to your on-chain address.

- Day trading and Scalping. In this case you should only keep as little money as you need for trading.

![[Pasted image 20240207195247.png]]

You can withdraw crypto to different networks/blockchains.

There are not only Bitcoin and Ethereum network but many others quite large, trusted ones. Solana or Arbitrum are good examples.

Many major decentralized apps are integrated with these chains.

Make sure you **don't use random scam blockchains** and make sure you **check which chain you wanna use**** before you take any action.
