### Be hardworking and relaxed (like tristan tate)


## Always filter out the noise, externally and internally


## With "Triggers", you can just not care


-Focus on the present task and don't worry about the long day, 
  you can always the a break whenever needed so no need to be
  overwhelmed



-When an urge of sin comes, set timer for 23min and see then if the
  thoughts are gone when the devil gives up"



-All the excess dopamine and useless habits make you feel more empty, 
  insecure, less energized and more anxious and stressed overtime. If you
  keep going long enough the synapses in your brain make new healthy ones.


  
-It takes **countless victories** in **small battles** to win the **whole war**. It's ok to fail, 
  it might even be necessary to realize how you **can** fail and how to avoid them
  in the future. It's okay fall into impulsive action as long as you stop it right when
  you are conscious about the action. That way you can come back and not spiral
  down into worse and worse behaviour.



-"You have to recognize that a fantasy is just a thought you had that progressed into a larger conscious experience.

Thoughts are like waves - you can catch them, and some of them can become huge and overpowering. The big ones (fantasies) can often suck you in quickly. It's important to remember you can always bail on the wave. Relinquish the thought; come back to the present moment."

-"For me I have to make a vow every single day to not PMO, and it works like a charm if you take it seriously. I made it to 30+ days easily with that method in my first serious streak at the start of this year, then I kinda got arrogant and I forgot the importance of doing this and so I relapsed and then I could only go a couple of days before relapsing again and again without this vow.

Now I'm back on it and it's easy again, making that promise to yourself daily or even several times a day if you need to, puts you in a very different mode where it's almost like you're a character in a game and fapping has been deleted from your moveset."

-Stop caring what others think. People care in the moment but in this modern hyperstimulative world we live in, as soon as the moment is over, people move over to the next thing. So don't
let these moments stay in your head and define your future.


All You need to do in life is **Born and Die**, nothing else

So no emotion is an excuse of doing something wrong. You never HAVE to do something

you can even be without fulfilling your physiological needs like breathing, food, water but you then have to die


#### Speedrun WC 

You have never done anything good while on phone while in bathroom. NEVER. Even if you think you have, you could've done a better job outside of bathroom. 

For now its more important to resist the temptations and urges --> Learn to control your emotions and master them --> use them for your advantage and not be scared or overwhelmed by them like before

### STOP BEING SO HARSH ON YOURSELF

The world is already throwing shit at you, why throw it yourself

On certain things you need to be harsh but most thing like not being perfect, just harms 

# Realize, you are not so mentally strong as you thought you were


### Before you act on emotion, pause for a min and think about what do you gain vs lose

What are the benefits or sanctions from the action your about to take or activity your about to partake in.

# AVOID ALL IMPULSIVE ACTIONS

reasons: ADHD and addictive personality 

these actions include:
- **Social media**, including **youtube** (if not planned)
- **Porn, Masturbating, Casual Sex**
- **Substances** (if not planned days before)
- **Food** (not just junkfood)
- **Videogames**

# ALWAYS DO THINGS WITH INTENTION

I'm gonna do X --> Because of Y

As said below

**Avoid** doing things on **impulse** and on **autopilot** 
cause there are always things you will do that are either **waste of time** or **done inefficienly**

## Constantly keep god in mind


## The Problems are only in your head

If you get out of your head and look yourself and the problem from 3rd person, outside perspective, 99% of the times the problem isn't a big deal.

## STOP LYING ABOUT THINGS: stop exaggerating, making up stories or saying you have tried something you haven't


### Don't use google translator all the time

If you keep thinking hard and come up with the right words, overtime you get rid of that bad habit and replace it with good one (translating yourself)



### When you don’t feel like working and your mind trying you to quit, remember

### If you keep pushing, at somepoint your mind and body think: ” okay our owner will work no matter how hard we try to interfere, so might as well just work with him”




I see a pattern where the longer the day has gone and less hours left, the more productive I become. So I need to find ways to trick my mind into thinking that I can stop the day and go to sleep earlier. Like the marathon runner who said to herself that she can take her gloves of on the next mile, every mile of the race. 

Need to be more mindfull and aware of time consumption, like how much each task takes time and could I improve it. Also sometimes taking a small "unproductive" thinking break could make things faster as you come up with a new better strategy/system for doing that repetive task.

Be the observer of your thoughs. I start to realize more and more how much I can control my thoughs. When a though occurs, instead of listening to it as absolute truth, question it and think it from different perspectives. Also remember that no matter how bad the thought or feeling is, you will forget it sooner than you think, especially when you dont give those thoughs any energy. 

Energy will flow where you target it. 

Try to make it a habit that always when deciding something which aint a nanodecision, listly quickly the pros and cons of the different options. Build the gut feeling by doing what it says cause usually when your mind isnt thinking critically, your gut is.    

And make it a habit to think every action you are about to take: if it is worth your time and standards or not. It makes a huge difference in the long game. And instead of jumping in blindly, always observe, orient and think how you can be optimal. Yeah it is more effort and brain calories but it will make you better at everything.
