There is a version of you who made every right decision, how is he?

Fears less, Stronger, Bigger, More Powerful, Kinder, Riches, More girls, Faster 


Everytimr you’re about to make a decision between working on yourself and some hedonistic pursuit

think to yourself

Which person you, deep in your hearth, want to be


![[IMG_2824.jpeg]]

If you take the **loser choice**, you’re saying to yourself:

I don’t want the great, fantastic future

I want a loser future

There always **ONE** decision that makes you the **superhero**

All the other ones make you a **fat cheeto eating ball of shame**
