### Ksenox's methods
## Entry method #1 Sweep of consolidation

![[Pasted image 20240407150613.png]]

- After first Breakout, Daily 12/21 Bands **must be green**
- After breakout price stayed over the broken level for over 10 days = confirmation of trend switch
- entry after price sweeps of consolidation lows (goes below last low and comes back above it )
Sweep the low = false breakout

### #1 way of entry (1D):

1. Sweep of consolidation
2. Wait for daily candle close above sweep level
3. Confirm 12/21 bands are still green
4. Enter on daily close
5. Stop loss below the wick

#### #1 way of entry (1H):

First look at volume:

- High volume on impulse = Harmony
- Low volume correction
- Low volume on sweep, confirms it was a stop hunt

##### Many ways to get better entry than daily:

- Second bullish candle after sweep
- After first BOS
- After 12/21 flip green

## Entry method #1 Perfect Entry on a breakout


This method is trying to catch first BOS when theres a new market phase

- Earliest entry for a swing
- Trying to find impulse which will not retrace

#### How to get entry for this move (1D):

### H4

- price bleeds for a week
- a single inpulse candle (w/really high volume) retraces whole week of price in one go

Market tells you clear validation: Stop loss below impulse candle

#### How to get better entries than just BOS candle:

1. Trigger 4H breakout
2. Get on 1H Timeframe
3. Look at 12/21 Bands

Not 50 EMA, that is not bullish as it too early to touch it

4. Partial Entry when price touches 12 Band (25% of position size)
5. Second Entry on next BOS (25%)
6. Last Entry is up to you (50%)

On the picture: 3rd entry is based of:

- people fomo in and get rekt by dump candle and wick
- on next two small candles, price could go either way
- 3rd bigger candle + 12/21 inflect upwards: ENTER (50% bc all signs of bullish trend have happened)

## 1H:

## 4H:

![[Pasted image 20240407160651.png]]

#### Simple exit rule:

- 4H 12/21 bands flip red (candle close)

### What if price doesn't touch the bands?

Price doesnt need to touch the bands, it needs to respect them and hold them

Example:

If you just entered 1D BOS

#### Better entry, go /4 timeframe:

- 1D -> 4H
- 4H -> 1H
- 1H --> 15min...

Look for:

1. High volume impulse (harmony)
2. Low volume correction
3. Entry on breakout candle (close or as its forming) (also high volume, harmony)

#### Second entry 50%

![[Pasted image 20240407162848.png]]

#### Backtest

Which exit is better:

- 1H 12/21 bands flip red
  or
- Bigger 12/21 bands flip red

### 1H:

### 4H:

### 1D:

Watch the trade on 4H or 1H


Day trading is mechanical, random based on context

Swing trading is based on only, is price going up


As long as we are under BTC ATH, this strategy is gonna print $
