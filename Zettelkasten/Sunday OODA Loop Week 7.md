6/10 Not a great week. Got things done but also slacked alot and didnt have full focus on the tasks I was doing. 	
	
On morning I didn't jump up immediately and didn't start my days with speed and artificial exitement	
	
Didnt follow morning plan which is why time management was so off and focus was not great as I forgot to meditate	
	
	
Fapped handful of times which just made me backtrack in attention and motivation. How do I think I can be excited to work on myself and my goals when I stare at thousands of hot girls on screen without having to put any effort for it 	
Say it again, I need standards of God, and never let them down, no matter how I feel or think. They are laws and I cant break them. 	
I always relapsed when there is too many tasks I am doing at the same time or stress about and I slip from my standards by tiny bit and then the snowball effect starts and then I stare at myself at the mirror, dissapointed and frustrated	
	
Didnt take regular breaks and always pushed myself to the limit in terms of time on the computer,. not based on effectiveness... 	
	
I realised that I havent recovered from gym sessions so I took days of which in of it self isnt that bad based on my fitness goals but didnt do active recovery or other activities and thats one huge part in the relapse to pmo	
	
If I let my self peek just a little, touch my self just a little, I will end up in a deep hole. 	
	
Did most of school work on time, but didnt take breaks and didnt define clearly what I need to do, so i impulsively side tracked a lot	
	
By not being presend and careful enough, I fucked up my base farm twice!!!!! 	
	
While talking to family,  I acted selfishly by expecting them to do what I think they need to do and use their free time for me. 	
Also still unintentionally make up white lies and unnessessary false parts of a story or explanation so I can sound more clever and be right.	
	
Realized how I have used the excuse of "I can do this loser activity once for now and then just continue where I left off" alot. It just doesn't work like that. Every present action is a small vote for building your future self. 	
If you enable one bad action, you are gonna do it again and again. Think about it, every addict and weak minded person says: "One more time, this is the last one and then I quit", yeah yeah
