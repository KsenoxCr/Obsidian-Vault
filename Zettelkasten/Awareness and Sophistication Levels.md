## Awareness

They might know their problem

or 

They might not

If they don't know --> starting point is the problem

### Blind Spots:

- Problem it's self
- Roadblock
- Solution

People can be product aware

### Where are they in the funnel?


## Sophistication Levels

#### Are they sophisticated about the market?

-Have they already tried to solve the problem
-Do they know a lot about your product or similar products in the market

#### For example gym niche:

Reader might be really into fitness already for a long time and know bunch of muscle building and weight dropping solutions, products, tips and tricks

or 

He/She might be totally newbie to the fitness scene and doesn't really know where to start and everything feels so complicated and he's overwhelmed by all the different programs and meal plans

or in between

All this things together define how you will **write to the audience**
