##### Bollinger bands consist of

- Middle line: Standard moving average 
- two lines above and below:  Standard deviation bands that develop the price action (1 SD)

#### Why do we use them

- To understand visually the volatility of a coin

By analysing width of the bands and price movements relative to them:

- Can identify periods of high or low volatility

#### They helps spot:

- Squeezes
- Trend changes
- Times to avoid trading



### Squeeze:

At the end of image, price bands get really tight = squeeze

tells us that the next move is probably gonna have high volatility

#### Avoid Trading when:

- Bands are tight and price is not moving much



#### Potential reversal:

Price barely closes outside of bands on the up side but then price falls down under them and has multiple closes under, indicating highly likely reversal
