## How to identify a Trend as early as possible

- Best swing trades present themselves on HTF, Best entries are 1H - 4H but need context of HTF
- 

Signals of trend reversal (quickest to slowest):

1. 12/21 Bands Cross
2. MSB
3. 50/100 MA Cross
4. 50/200 MA Cross

12/21 bands are **faster** than 50/100/200 but it **doesn't mean they are better**

When 50 crosses 200, it can be obvious that we are in a down trend

Its not enough that 50, 100 and 200 bands are in the desired order, they also need to slope to the direction of the trend



As a swing trader, you are not trying to long the reversal

12/21 is **not entry signal**, it is **early identifier**
