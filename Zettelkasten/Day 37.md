7/10. Attention was breaking easily while re watching copywriting lessons. Procrastinated much today an the main reason is not having as busy schedule as usual (so it thought). Fapped again because I didn't have the reasons in mind im not doing it anymore. It is a drug like any other and need to have same boundaries as with weed.

Cleaning aparment from top to bottom takes longer than I thought cause have never done it before so it continues tomorrow. 

Performed best at early day and at night. 

I need ultimate focus on THIS MOMENT and this moment only (its a skill I lack at). need to incorporate useful tacticts like breaking tasks into smaller ones and stopping habits into fighting mini battles to conquer my problems 

PS. Dont punish yourself on doing the bad habits on automation. Only when you truly decide to do them and know fully the consequences.
