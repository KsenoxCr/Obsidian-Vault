## Never hold cash, Cash is a liability

Holding cash has risk

There's always something that will outperform cash

#### Bullmarket = Risk assets (Stocks: S&P, NASDAQ, Crypto)

#### Recession = Goverment Bonds

#### Inflation = Gold


## Cash is Trash

If you owned a 50k house 100 years ago --> today its millions

Do you think there is so much more people around that the demand has increased min 20x 

NO

Money has devalued, that's why


## Warren Buffet Strategy

-Buy Stocks as they as they, in the long-term, grow around 9% a year.
-Get paid dividence for owning a slice of then companies
-Reinvest these profits buying more stocks

= creates reflexive loop 

--> overtime, stocks go up

#### If economy grows (always has been), market grows 

market is the economy reflected

If (economy.grow) {
	companies.grow: (
		profits,
		revenue,
	);
	 --> companies get bigger
} 

As money gets inflated by the fed --> Stocks go up even more

## $10 million x 1.09/year (9% compound) x 20 years = $56 million

So as rich know their assets grow overtime

they **borrow against their holdings**

and use that borrowed money to reinvest and live of it

## Intelligent rich people use hedging

Ex. 60/40,   60% stocks and 40% = less risk cause

as stock do bad, bond do well and flipped


but now we have a new assest that is the scarcest assets in the world

and that is...

## Bitcoin

its more scarce that gold, which is known as the scarcity asset

bitcoin inflates less than gold

It also goes up faster than other assets

and with the new ETF

bitcoin is gonna be part of the 60/40 plan, ex. 30/30/30
