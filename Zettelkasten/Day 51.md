Use Timers For G Work Sessions (no time to worry that way)

7/10. Fapped once and wasted so almost 2h watching nsfw content and I didn't like a second if. The main problem was that as the mental fog started to build up and i couldnt think clearly, I didnt jump out of the chair and do something else. Its most hard to resist the urges when physically still and full of energy. 

Wasted time on school assignment by googling to much internal thoughts and questions that come and go if i let them also and not implementing timer properly. Also ate right before which affected focus. 

Used pretty low amount of dopamine sources like music or videos on the background. I have to keep it that way. Save them for when times get tough and little help would be benefitial 

Need to analyze every action I take, not judging with negative self talk but with exitement to learn, grow and get better and better.
