"Being a powerful man isnt always about furious anger and instilling fear.

As enemies attempt to attack your energy and lower your vibration -

Understand this.

Power is untouchable.
Power notices but doesn't care.

Sometimes power is simply not giving a fuck."


If you want to be happy --> unhappy

If you don't care about happiness and want to become great --> you become happy (on the side) 



"If you lack somewhere, focus on where you are good

Hone your other capabilities

If you are ugly --> become filty rich

If you are poor --> become strong as ox"

"Evolution requires PAIN

While others complain they don't feel happy enough. 

I'm happy that I'm struggling

I don't want to be happy...

I want to be GREAT

This is the beauty of the life as a MAN"
