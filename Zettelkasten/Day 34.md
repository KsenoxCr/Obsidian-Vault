8/10. Did everything pretty good but on the studies was many times out of focus because of touching my self... which could have been prevented... I need to remember that by doing that I'm allowing myself an excuse to fall deeper down the hole. 

Managed to build client's website further but wasted much time on finding one setting though it had to be found but could have let my ego down, stopped for few mins and come back without being frustrated at the problem.

Fapped for an hour which is MINUS ROI and because of that didn't have time to organize notes...
Went to sleep at 3 am which was so too late.
