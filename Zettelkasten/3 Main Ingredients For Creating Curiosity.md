FIRST you need to understand what they super care about: Top Desires, Pains, Fears, Dreams, 

Opportunity/Threat that is linked to what they really care about

### 1. Subject they super care about
### 1. Reveal part of information about subject
### 2. Allude to/reference more info/details/things they need to have to know the full picture

If one part is missing they:

1. **Aren't as interested**. Now it's just a puzzle but they don't have a motive to solve it
2. **They don't believe**, what ever your teasing, **is** **real**
	-There needs to be details for the brain to latch on to

As copywriter you:

Create Curiosity = Urge to know the missing info --> Reader takes action (CTA) --> Reader gets rewarded by getting the missing info + new urge to know new info gap 

--> cycle continues up the value ladder

In other words

--> Curiosity = little dopamine --> Take the action --> Fill Info Gap = bigger Dopamine Hit
