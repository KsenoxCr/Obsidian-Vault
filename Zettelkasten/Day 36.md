8/10. Didn't waste that much time in the morning. Went to the gym early and used super sets well to lower the time spent at there. Didn't stretch that but it was arm day so acceptable. 

Fapped multiple times... Everytime I thought I have to do as the though/emotion told me as it is so strong but you dont have to be it slave. On next urges, do as the reddit told: pushups, cold shower, walk, meditate. but first stop and let the feeling be and learn to be okay with that feeling the same way with any other feeling. 

Was angry at my mom even tho she tried to help and was on holiday. I just made the situation worse and made me emotionally weaker. I used excuses for my behavour. There are no excuses to talking negatively to mom even when it is just really slight aggression. 

Focused well to task before sleeping as usual. 

Next day I will focus on not doing things on autopilot and not try to stimulate my mind with things that might seem productive but are actually counterproductive as I'm not focusing and listening to them (videos and podcast). I have used them as a sort of escape of the chatter in mind. The chatter is there for a reason and can be used to create amazing ideas but it also is behind the roadblock of hard work.

Didn't go Instrumentarium cause wanted to fap instead which was plainly idiotic decision. Next time when there is that kind of decision ahead, 

I need to make up a reward for doing the work first and then feel proud for doing it and then have that reward.
