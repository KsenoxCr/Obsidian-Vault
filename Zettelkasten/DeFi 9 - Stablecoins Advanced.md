### **Designing stablecoins**

You can't just decide that something is worth $1, but that's what stable coins actually want to achieve. Stablecoins are always pegged to a price instead of being priced by supply and demand. To achieve this they have to be properly designed and maintained. There are a few ways to achieve this. All of the current designs have their pros and cons. There are some desirable traits of the perfect stablecoin but still no stablecoin has all of them: **- Price stable (collateralized)** **- Decentralized** **- Capital Efficient**

### Fiat-backed stable coins

These are backed by some kind of currency like the US dollar. Behind every coin there is a fiat equivalent locked up somewhere. 

They are price stable as they are properly collateralized and capital efficient as well. They are centralized though. Companies and governments can freeze the funds.

As of today they are still the safest way to be exposed to crypto.

$USDC, $USDT, $BUSD are the largest ones on the market.

### Crypto-backed stable coins

You can lock up coins to mint the stable coin through smart contracts. Since token prices can change this solution needs overcollateralization.

They are price stable and decentralized but not capital efficient thanks to overcollateralization.

There are more risks involved with these. First of course that some of the assets used as collateral could go to 0 in which case the stable coin wouldn't be 100% backed anymore. There is also smart contract risk.

$DAI and $LUSD are the most important ones in this category.


### Crypto-backed stablecoins II

It's very important to differentiate between crypto-backed stablecoins that are backed by other stablecoins (USDC/USDT) and the ones backed by $BTC and $ETH.

It makes sense to have some exposure to $LUSD (fully backed by $ETH) if most of your stable holdings are USDT/USDC. In this case you basically bet on $ETH and remove yourself to be 100% exposed to fiat-backed stablecoins.

DAI is backed by stablecoins (USDC/USDT) and other coins ($ETH for instance) as well.

### Algo stablecoins

Some people believe that collateralization is not necessary for stable coins, as long as they can maintain a stable value of $1 through algorithmic mechanisms. 

However, most stable coins that have attempted this approach have collapsed, such as $LUNA. 

These "algo stables" are capital efficient and decentralized, but they are also not fully collateralized and may carry smart contract risk. 

They are generally considered the riskiest type of stable coin, and it is not recommended to hold them.

### Summary

There are also hybrid stable coins, like $FRAX, which are a combination of the three main types of stable coins. 

However, none of the existing stable coins are perfect. The safest way to hold stable coins at present is through fiat collateralized stable coins like $USDC, $USDT, and $BUSD.

 It is not recommended to invest in algo stablecoins due to their high risk.
