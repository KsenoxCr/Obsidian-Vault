# Plan Review

## Reverse engineering is better than forward engineering

- Gets you to your dream outcome faster 
- Atleast work from both end until you meet in the middle

Pick a niche. 

## The plan needs to be 


## Plan morning plans into calendar not into obsidian 

- So I will see if I'm actually making progress or just running on still, doing some kind of religious ritual hoping that so day it will pay off

## Plan the whole process from current moment to desired outcome to calendar in as much detailed as possible (micro task level)

- Less time wasted
- Less errors to be made
- Back up plans if something doesn't work
- and really getting shit done instead of running a circle

## Good example of assumpts and unknowns

## Don't just identify weakpoints. Also plan how to compensate for them

Dont just think: "This could kill me"

Think: "This could kill me. How can I eliminate this enemy or block against it"


## The most goofy ideas of resources are in many times the most useful ones


## Get a many doubts aka unknowns out of the way (using your resources)

Address and fix the problems, assumptions and unknowns at the beginning, now

## And overbudget your plan, be over prepared




## Goals need to mid term



## Point of moving things from list to calendar is getting the things done (in time).

Takes the task from "Should do" to "Will do". Makes it more real 



## Plan needs to make sense and be real

- Need to be aggressive but also realistic to actually believe it and make it happen
