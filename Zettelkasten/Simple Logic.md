Give them a logical reason why should they believe

### People buy with emotion, Justify with logic

## Too much logic KILLS emotion

Connect statements of claim or benefits --> reason why

## Basic Patterns

### If... Then...

**If** you vape less --> **then** have better stamina

If you eat in a calorie deficit --> **Then** you lose weight

### Therefore

### Because


### Metaphors

If it's really common and believable --> they're gonna understand that

Example: If you don't sleep enough your gonna burn out

Metaphor: If you don't rest your car engine and run it on high RPM it's engine is gonna explode
