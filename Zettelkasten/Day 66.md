7/10. Spend too much time on farming as I didnt put on a timer. Wasted the morning by being slow and not having a hurry on, not following the days plan (in the back of mind thinking there is time to waste). Watched porn out of bad emotional control but didnt fap thank god. 

Gym went alright but should I used supersetting more and again didnt eat enough during the day so not that much power in me. Also felt the weakness from ejaculating so much lately...
