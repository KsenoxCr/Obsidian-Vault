8/10. Better morning than before. got things started quicker

Again spend time lacking with school. I have to think that the more quickly I get school shit done I can focus on more important and fun stuff. 

Again the fucking breaks where missing. spend too much time in the gym. was distracted a lot because lowered my standards to do those other things. Need to keep them high ALWAYS. 

Poor time management and not wanting to stop tasks meant that I didn't have time to backtest. Need to implement a time table of thing I have to do and follow it regiliously. Spend time arguing on the phone with mom which was useless and wrong, I let my emotions control me in that moment.



Use Timers For G Work Sessions (no time to worry that way)
