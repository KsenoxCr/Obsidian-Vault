### **The importance of money**

You use money every single day, but when you really think about how to define it, the task is harder than it looks. In this lesson we will compare $BTC to money and gold.

### **Functions of money**

To understand why cryptocurrencies are great, you have to know the functions and properties of money and see how crypto can be better than fiat or gold. 

Money (fiat, gold, any kind) has these primary functions: 

- Store of value 
- Medium of exchange 
- Unit of account 

Some people also like to include the following: - Standard of deferred payment

### **Functions of money II**

**Store of value** 

For something to be considered money, it _**must maintain its value over time.**_ This means if you hold onto that money today, it will maintain/grow its value until tomorrow, next week, or even next year. If your money can rot, it’s a not a good store of value. It has to be durable like gold. 

#### **Medium of exchange**

The main purpose of money is to settle transactions. Real money _**can be used to trade goods**_. With no money the only way to exchange goods would be through direct exchange like bartering.

### **Functions of money III**

#### **Unit of account** 

Proper money serves an _**agreed-upon measure of the value of goods**_. A unit of account is the unit in which you denominate prices. How do you measure the price of a home? It is the price denominated in USD or in ounces of gold? That’s your unit of account. 

#### **Standard of deferred payment** 

Debt is one of the primary uses of money, as it allows individuals and businesses to buy goods and services now and pay for them in the future. Money is widely accepted as a way to value a debt, as **it allows for the exchange of goods and services in the economy.** Without debt, the economy would be significantly limited.

**Store of value** - Although **BTC** is still volatile, its value is expected to grow over time, has a limited cap, and it's not perishable. 

**Medium of exchange** - **BTC** has not yet been adopted as a widespread medium of exchange. It's getting there though. $BTC is for instance an accepted form of payment in El Salvador.

**Unit of account** - **BTC** will be a great unit of account if it indeed grows as we expect it. But right now BTC needs more adoption and liquidity to be used as unit of account.

**Standard of deferred payment** - **$BTC** needs more adoption to be used as debt obligation.


#### **Properties of money**

**Durability**

Money shouldn't be perishable. That's why gold was so important. Paper money is durable as well and can be easily replaced even if the bill gets worn out. 

**Portability** 

This means how easily you can take your money from one place to another? Gold is heavy and hard to transport for instance. Paper money is much easier to transport.


#### **Properties of money II**

**Uniformity** 

A $10 bill is worth the same as any other $10 bill. They are fungible. You can always swap one piece for another and it will be worth the same.

**Divisibility**

It means how easy it is to divide the money so we can buy goods of different value. For instance it's as easy to buy a chocolate for $1 as a car for $50,000. You can buy the chocolate with one $1 bill or 4 quarters and you can buy the car with 500 pieces of $100 or 1000 pieces of $50 bills.


#### **Properties of money III**

**Scarcity**

Money has to have limited cap otherwise its value will be inflated. Gold is a limited resource in nature. Paper money can be printed but it's controlled by the governments. 

**Acceptability** 

For something to be real money, it must be accepted by many entities in order to be exchanged for other goods.


#### **Properties of money for cryptocurrencies**

**Durability** 

Cryptos are durable as they live on the blockchain and they are not perishable. As long as there are computers around cryptocurrencies will be there too. 

**Portability** 

Crypto is super portable. With computer access you send your money over anywhere within a few seconds or minutes. Besides that there is no real physical manifestation as it is on the blockchain. No one can take it from you.



#### **Properties of money for cryptocurrencies II**

**Uniformity** 

Fungible tokens in crypto are all the same. If you have $BTC coins that are worth let's say $1k then any other same amount of coins will be worth $1k as well. There are NFT's as well (non-fungible tokens) which of course are not uniform. 

**Divisibility** 

$BTC can be divided to 1⁄100000000 (one hundred millionth) bitcoin also known as sat. If 1 $BTC was worth $100 mil then 1 sat would be worth $1.



### **Properties of money for cryptocurrencies III**

**Scarcity** 

$BTC has a limited cap of 21,000,000. This means $BTC can't be inflated once it reaches that total supply. This is great since it can't be printed like fiat money.

**Acceptability**

$BTC is not widely accepted yet but the adoption is on the way. As mentioned earlier it's already an accepted way of payment in El Salvador for instance.
