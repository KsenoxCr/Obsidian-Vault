## Backtesting

- Always check that the backtesting sheet is correct before starting backtest and waste time when realize you marked results on the wrong sheet...
- If the take TP is "on the opposite side MSB"... **NEVER move SL** even if the opposite side msb happened. It only matters on the profit side as it **messes up the systems calculated Total and Avg R**

## Holdings
- Leaving huge sums of money to CEX (Mistakes: kucoin $1k in AKT and Binance $2,6K in USDT)

## Farming

- Send any tokens to old "failed" farm, that links the farms together and filters out as sybil attack
