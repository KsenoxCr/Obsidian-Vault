## No Negative outcomes can come to someone who: 

- Journals their thoughts and emotions everyday
- Analyzed the market every morning
- Plans out every single trade with a full thesis
- Takes screenshots of each different timeframe
- Anotates the chart of what their looking at/why they are considering a trade
- Thinks about the trade before they enter
- Wait for price to come to a level
- Enters the trade with a limit order
- Uses a fixed preset mount of risk
- Allows the trade to play out

## You have to do it all, No alternative
