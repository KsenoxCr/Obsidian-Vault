Whenever you wanna use some De-Fi platform you should be able to estimate if it's worth taking the risk using the protocol.

Staking calculations have already been discussed in previous lessons. 

In that example though we assumed that the yield would stay the same over time which is usually not the case especially if the protocol is new and hyped.


### Emission

Always look at the source of the emissions.

If it comes as revenue share from protocol usage, that's very healthy. Protocols are rewarding their users.

If it comes from inflating protocol tokens then understand why it's happening and how. New protocols have to provide incentives to build up initial liquidity. The larger the emission the larger the APR. Remember, protocols inflate their tokens with this, so large emission can't go on forever as it create selling pressure.

If you see large emissions it will only last for a shorter period of time.

### **Emission schedule**

You should always look at emission schedule to estimate APR and also to evaluate the project itself. It's super important to know for instance if there is some huge unlocks upcoming or the token distribution is totally screwed from the start.

### Token price

You should take into consideration what tokens needed as LP (if applies) and what tokens are emitted. The tokens you LP with can suffer IL. The token that is emitted can be inflated.

Emission in $ = Number of emitted tokens x Price of emitted tokens

Token price rise is directly proportional with the APR growth.

In some cases you will see combined emission numbers if there are more tokens used as reward.

In this example you can see the reward is the combination of 3 different tokens, although the emission for the second and third token have already gone down close to 0.

If the token gets to inflated and worthless then of course emission will go to 0. 

This happens to many protocols that are not used after the mercenary farmers leave the protocol, nobody wants to invest into the governance token, and nobody uses the protocol anymore.

### TVL

TVL means total value locked. It can refer to all the vaults/liquidity pools/etc of the whole protocol or it can refer to just one particular vault/pool. TVL basically means liquidity and De-Fi protocols need liquidity to function properly.

In the example below you can see the first liquidity pool has $1,116,811 and the second pool has $2,123,325 locked in.

In this case it means that the LP tokens that have been added to the pool so far are worth that much money.

For the first pool the TVL equals:

Number of $HERMES x Price of $HERMES + Number of $METIS x Price of $METIS

For the second pool the TVL equals:

Number of $METIS x Price of $METIS + Number of $USDC x Price of $USDC

### TVL ll.

As the TVL grows the rewards will decrease in an inversely proportional fashion. This happens as rewards are distributed among people who contribute to the TVL.

If the TVL is close to 0 that's usually not a good sign. In this case the protocol/vault/pool is either super fresh and there is huge smart contract and scam risk, or the protocol/vault/pool is just not useful at all.

If the TVL is huge then of course the APR is much lower. The successful De-Fi protocols have reach this over several years. At this stage the protocols are very useful and have no reason to emit too much coins and inflate their tokens. These are usually very safe with trusted teams and battle tested smart contracts. Whales like to use them as they prefer protecting their capital and they care less about huge returns.

### **Summary**

- APR % = Emitted token price x Emitted tokens yearly x 100 / TVL

- You should always take a look at the emission schedule as well to see how many tokens will be emitted in the future.

- The token price is directly proportional with the APR.

- The TVL is inversely proportional with the APR.

- Make sure you understand the risks. If it's a liquidity pool you can suffer IL.

- Always consider smart contract risk.
