8.5/10. Wasted time and energy by looking at pics of escs fantasising about them when I could have used that sexual energy and frustration to as motivation to conquer and get better, rich. Lacked focus on studies as I had useless breaks. Wasted time in the morning looking at burpee technique videos which was cope to now go and do it. Focused really well on agoge assignment. looked at others for little inspiration and to not make it wrong and waste time starting again. Other tasks and gym I did pretty greatly. Always much room for improvement as there is always. Went to sleep 4 hour too late, thats why the 8.5 score. Otherwise a good day
