Make it as vivid as possible. What does he FEEL like as he goes through each part of his day? Add images vision board style. Use the first person and present tense, i.e. “I walk through the streets…” 

- I wake up at 6 am and jump out of bed ready to conquer. First I pray god to lend me his strength to win the day. While brushing my teeth, imagining and manifesting the victories of the day ahead. I slide in to the cold shower and stand there like a status. After I train viciously hard and push through yesterdays PRs. Pre workout is time for clean, nutritious meal that I am grateful for. I start working hard, stretching my brains creativity to almost edge of insanity, grinding g work session after g work session to write masterpiece copy that makes my clients happy with the results they get. When done with the copy I’ll eat another healthy and nutritious meal and right away start backtesting and improving my trading systems putting everything into getting even a single .01 R improvement. I analyze the market and journal my trades and thoughts diving deep to the deep end, root of trading emotions, pushing every great insight and thesis to the surface and from there to the journal. After everything else is completed I pray and thank god for his strength and help throughout the day. Then I go to sleep at 22 pm feeling proud of my work, resting for an even better day that is tomorrow.
