It's purely about mindset

In history there was no chance to go from slave to king

there was no protein, no breaks, no money

Today it can be done!

### Different Mindsets

## Kings/Winners

- Noble
- Brave
- Powerful
- Beautiful
- Abundance
- Assertive
- Direct action
- Life Affirming

## Slaves/Losers

- Base
- Fearful
- Weak
- Ugly
- Scarcity
- Non-assertive
- Subversion
- Life Negating

Slaves lived in bad circumstances and didn't have a way out 
and all they saw was the kings having fun eating grapes, talking 
about philosophy. 

So they did mental gymnastics to feel better. 
They created this mindset that rich are evil and it's so much better
to not be addicted to material things and be humble soul etc.

Modern world is trying to implant the values to us to make us modern slaves
