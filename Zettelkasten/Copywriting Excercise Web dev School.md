Amy, 25 yo, girl with long hair and nerdy glasses, USA, introvert who went college and gratuated with mediocre grades. Wasn't the most popular and the best academically the school. After she graduated she went to work as a restaurant waiter in olive garden. She's has been there for few years now and hasn't enjoyed it at all. She has a creative mind and likes to build things, not serve people --> job not fulfilling. 

Day to day life: She wakes up unmotivated and snoozes for few times, not wanting to wake up for work. When she finally jumps up, she quickly does here morning routine and heads up on legs towards olive garden. As she arrives she's tired before the day has even begun cause she knowns how long day is ahead. As she serves she keeps this smiling mask on while burning inside. As the work day finally ends shes already frustrated at the fact that tomorrow waits the same kind of day. After work she walks back to home feeling exhausted as she lies down to her boyfriends arms. On the sofa shes brainstorming other career paths to take but not sure if to go back to school or not as she wasnt the greatest at learning there. As the days over she crawls to bed anxious about tomorrow.
