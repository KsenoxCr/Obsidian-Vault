8/10. didnt backtest much because focused on lessons to understand concepts better so dont waste time testing wrongfully.

Didnt brainstorm ideas as should have and wasted time speaking on the phone/snapping useless convos. 

Implemented breaks and g work much better

Trained hard in the gym

Listened/Watched videos so broke the rule of podcast only

Fucked up time schedule by talking to miguel but it happens. 

Fapped which lowered my energy levels and focus significantly.


Did  breath work and need to do it much more often instead of basic meditation
