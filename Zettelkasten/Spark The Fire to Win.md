Think and imagine, how you felt on your last victories?

"Were you on top of the world, beam of light for others, feeling pride"

In order to keep the flames big...
### You need to think everyday:

- What new standards I need to set for myself
- What new systems/habits I need to build and use
- What new non-negotiables I need to enforce

to feel that fire burning again!
