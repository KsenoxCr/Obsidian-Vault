**Always check all the necessary steps upfront otherwise you might end up paying too much gas plus bridge/exchange fees for no reason.**

- Check if you have the coin that you have to pay gas with on a chain you wanna bridge to. If not then figure out how you get some of those tokens there first.

- Check where your coins are currently that you wanna bridge and use.

- Check what coins/NFT's you wanna buy on a certain chain and make sure you wanna buy it on that particular chain. Some coins are available on many chains so you might not have to bridge at all.



- Check if there is any trustable bridges that you can use to move your coins.

- Check if there is any trustable exchanges that you can use to move your coins.

- Check all the steps and transactions you have to make and take into consideration the bridging/exchange/gas fees.

- Check if you need exchanges/bridges or maybe both to get what you need.

 - Check where it's cheapest and safest to bridge

1. **Multichain**: Most assets and chains, second cheapest

2. **Synapse**: Okay chains, higher fees (not big deal on one time bridging)

3. **Stargate**: Cheapest, not many chains

**What is bridging?** 

A cross-chain bridge (or just simply bridge) is a dApp that gives you the power to transfer your cryptocurrencies and information from one blockchain to another. 

**Why would you need this?** 

Some coins or NFT's are only available on certain chains and you wanna send money there to buy them.


### **Getting money on-chain for the first time**

Whenever you wanna use a new chain you might have to get money on that chain first to be able to pay for gas. Some bridges will turn some of your money in gas paying token on the new chain if you want to.

If you don't have any money on any chains yet then you will have to buy tokens first on an exchange (or some other centralized product) then send it to the chain. For instance you would buy $BNB and send it to BNB Smart Chain (BEP-20) to be able to pay for transactions fees. Then you can interact with dApps on that chain like buying alts on its DEX's.

### **Using exchanges to move money to a different chain**

Large exchanges usually let you withdraw your money onto several chains.

If you have to move your money through exchanges (e.g. you gotta on-ramp, already on an exchange) and you wanna get your money on a particular chain then it might be more beneficial to just to withdraw from an exchange directly to the chain if possible.

You always have to check which exchanges allow withdrawal to a particular chain that you wanna use. If there is no direct way from the exchange to the chain then you have to figure the most optimal way.

That could be either sending your money to a different exchange and withdraw from there to the particular chain that you wanna use or move your money on-chain and then bridge to a different chain from there.

## **Bridging**

![[Pasted image 20240209004557.png]]

When you do bridging you are interacting with a bridge dApp. You will have to use your non-custodial wallet like Metamask. You connect your wallet to the dApp and choose the network in Metamask that you wanna send the tokens from.

Only certain larger cap tokens are available to bridge and it also depends on which chain accepts a certain coin. As it was mentioned earlier some tokens are only available on one chain, so you won't be able to bridge them.

Because of this you always have to figure out your steps before you start making any moves.

It's possible that sometimes you have to trade some of your tokens for $USDC for instance on a DEX on a certain chain. Then you bridge $USDC to the other chain and then you use that $USDC to buy the token you want on another DEX.


### Chain specific bridges

Many chains have their own bridges to make sure to bring in more people onto their chain. 

Because of that you always have to choose the chain the support as origin or destination.

Binance Bridge - https://www.bnbchain.org/en/bridge
Arbitrum Bridge - https://bridge.arbitrum.io/
Polygon Bridge - https://wallet.polygon.technology/

Other chains have their bridges as well. Always look up the best possible option for the chain you wanna bridge too.

Cross-chain bridges

For these type of bridges you can freely choose origin and destination as well from the supported chains.

Stargate - https://stargate.finance/

### **Withdrawing money with exchanges instead of bridges**

Instead of bridging you can also move your money with exchanges as you can send/receive money to several chains in many cases.

Sometimes this is the only way to send some coins from on-chain or from another exchange to your exchange that allows withdrawal to a certain chain.

**You always have to check all your options** before you coins any money or you try to bridge. 

### **When and what to bridge**

If you already have money on-chain and you don't need to withdraw money from exchanges then it's usually a better deal to just do bridging directly. 

It's also much better privacy wise as you don't have to KYC yourself.

Usually you will bridge one of the network tokens ($ETH, $BNB, $SOL, $USDC, $USDT, $BUSD) as most tokens are only available on their mother chain and they are not liquid enough even if they are available on other chains.

Don't forget that you have to move some tokens that you can pay gas with to the new chain first. 

If you wanna buy on Avalanche chain and you bridge some $USDC then you can't buy tokens as long as you can't pay for the gas which is paid in $AVAX.

### **Check all the steps upfront before bridge/using an exchange

**Always check all the necessary steps upfront otherwise you might end up paying too much gas plus bridge/exchange fees for no reason.**

- Check if you have the coin that you have to pay gas with on a chain you wanna bridge to. If not then figure out how you get some of those tokens there first.

- Check where your coins are currently that you wanna bridge and use.

- Check what coins/NFT's you wanna buy on a certain chain and make sure you wanna buy it on that particular chain. Some coins are available on many chains so you might not have to bridge at all.



- Check if there is any trustable bridges that you can use to move your coins.

- Check if there is any trustable exchanges that you can use to move your coins.

- Check all the steps and transactions you have to make and take into consideration the bridging/exchange/gas fees.

- Check if you need exchanges/bridges or maybe both to get what you need.

 - Check where it's cheapest and safest to bridge
