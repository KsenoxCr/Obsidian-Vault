- What count as a pump



- For stoplosses, can I use not so clear level? For instance on box method, aggressive stop might be too aggressive, but then conservative stop might be too limiting profits too much, What about just 25 % from the top of the box

- What is too high for box breakout so that it is more likely to be a top that is bleeding down rather than higher high, higher low? Example below:

Hey Prof. I have a huge problem that keeps me stuck not making real progress with my systems.

I have slight autism and I also program for work so I think a lot in binary terms, meaning things either are something or they are not. 

That shows up in trading in a way that I have hard time deciding when the price  has formed a certain pattern or if it was just random chop

The problem with my systems is that I can't seem to find the middle ground of being specific and vague about rules. 

If the rules are ambiguous, then that leaves room for opinion which makes it not a real system anymore.

But usually I make the rules too strict so that I miss a bunch of valid setups just because they didn't follow a textbook like, perfect price action.

I have this problem with pretty much all concepts that cannot be identified or calculated precisely. For example market structure, support and resistance or trend lines.

An example would be the under over pattern. As you have said in the lessons, most often the price doesn't test the left shoulder level perfectly, it either goes slightly through it or doesn't touch it but comes near it. 

How could I make rules for the retest that doesn't leave room for opinion but also without sabotaging myself by being too strict?
