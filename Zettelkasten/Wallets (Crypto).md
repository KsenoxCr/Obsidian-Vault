### **What is a wallet?**

Cryptocurrency is stored on the blockchain in a specific address (EOA), which can be accessed with a public and private key.

A wallet acts as an interface to access this address and manage your cryptocurrency. A crypto wallet is a device, a program, or a service which stores the public and/or private keys that give you access to your cryptocurrencies.

If you lose your physical wallet device, you can recover your account with a seed phrase. Essentially, a cryptocurrency address is like a safety deposit box and the public key is the box number, while the private key is the key to open it. 

The wallet itself is like a keyholder that provides an easy way to access your cryptocurrency..


### **Hot vs cold wallets**


There are 2 main groups for crypto wallets. 

**Hot wallets (Metamask)** are the ones that have a direct connection to the internet. This wallet can be a phone app, online provider, or desktop software program. 

**Cold wallets (Ledger)** are portable devices that provide the capability to “carry” your crypto money. Since you interact with the assets offline, this option is more secure than hot wallets.

### **Custodial vs non-custodial wallets**

Centralized exchanges, such as Binance and Coinbase, hold control over your wallet and private key, which is known as a custodial wallet. This can be risky if the exchange experiences issues or goes out of business, as your funds may be frozen or lost. On the other hand, a non-custodial wallet like Metamask gives you full control over your private key and is a safer option for storing most of your funds. 

It is recommended to only keep a small amount of funds on centralized exchanges for trading purposes and using them as an on-ramp/off-ramp for fiat currencies.

The saying "Not your keys, not your coins" refers to the importance of having control over your own private key in order to truly own your cryptocurrency.


### **Recommended Wallets**

The hot, non-custodial wallet that you should use is Metamask. If you have at least a few thousand $ worth of crypto then you should also use cold wallets for extra safety.

You can easily connect cold wallets to Metamask and use the Metamask interface to interact with your cold wallet.

The recommended cold wallets are Ledger Nano S Plus and Trezor. Always buy the physical device on the official site and always reset your device before using it.

Never type the cold wallet seed phrase accidentally in a hot wallet.

### **Different blockchains**

There are several blockchains that have their own wallet solutions.

Metamask for instance can only be used for Ethereum and other EVM compatible chains like Fantom or Avalanche.

Phantom wallet is a good wallet for Solana chain for instance but can only be used for Solana and no other chain.

Most chains of course have several wallet options as well. You always wanna stick with one of the most used ones as those are less likely to be exploited and are integrated with most of the dApps.  



### Non-custodial wallets


You should always check which one is the best wallet for a particular chain. Usually your wallets will be browser extensions.

Usually you will use Ethereum and other EVM compatible chains, so you will use Metamask. There are other options that have better privacy but only Metamask is integrated with most of the dApps. If privacy is super important to you then you can research more wallets. Only use Metamask with Chrome and Brave browsers.

At the end of the day the non-custodial wallets work in a similar way, so if you learn one of them very well, then learning to use the other ones should be easy. In the lessons Metamask will be used.


### **Non-custodial wallet rules**

Non-custodial wallets are more prone to human error. If you make a mistake your money will be gone.

- Protect your seed phrase. If someone gets access to your private key then your money will be gone. You shoould only ever type it in the wallet interface.
- As your crypto portfolio grows have several accounts with several addresses and split up your money among them. If one of your accounts/addresses gets exposed then you will only lose a small portion of your portfolio.
- If you have at least a few thousand in crypto then use hardware wallet for extra safety. Hardware wallets won't protect you from everything though.
- Have separate wallets (burner wallet) with little money to interact with protocols. Only authorize applications that look safe.


### On-ramp/off-ramp setup

On-ramp means that you buy crypto with fiat money.
Off-ramp means that you sell crypto for fiat money.

You need access to an exchange or other payment infrastructure products to on-ramp/off-ramp money.

You send fiat to the exchange then trade it for crypto ($ETH). After on-ramp, you send the coin to your on-chain address that you can access with your non-custodial wallet.

If you want to cash out, send the coins to the exchange from your non-custodial wallet, then trade the coins for fiat money and send it to your bank account.

### **When to use a centralized exchange**

- On-ramp/Off-ramp means that you buy crypto with fiat money

- Some coins are only liquid enough or available to trade on exchanges. In this case send your coins to the exchange, then make the trade on the exchange, then send your coins back to your on-chain address.

- Day trading. In this case you should only keep as little money as you need for trading.
