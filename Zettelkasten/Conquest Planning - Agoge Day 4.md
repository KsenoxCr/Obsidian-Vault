## Take full accountability of the outcomes and problems in your life

look at the mirror

Everything you have is the result of everything you have done

Everything you donâ€™t have is the result of not doing the needed things


### "In preparing for battle, I have alwas found that plans are useless but planning is indispensable"

Reality is gonna look really different from the plan but

Sitting down planning, you will:
- Learn the terrain, know possible problems 
- Prepare yourself for the battle ahead

## How to make plans that work 

### 1. Pick and objective and define it
### 2. Work your way backwards, making detailed movie of each checkpoint

### 3. List out the cause & effect chain that leads to those checkpoints

### 4. Identify unknowns and assumptions

### 5. Anticipate the biggest challenges/problems you will face

### 6. Identify resources you can use to overcome those challenges

### 7. List out the tasks you need to do with the times they need to happen by

### 8. Hold yourself accountable to hit your tasks in the time allotted

### 9. Adjust plan as you learn new information




# 1. Pick and define your objective

- Focus on **short/mid term objectives**
- Make sure they are as **exciting** and **important** and **meaningful** as possible
- **Define** **success**. What will it look/sound/smell/feel like? **Get** **vivid** and **specific** with it


# 2. Plot your course

- Work your way backwards and list the checkpoints along the way
- Each checkpoint is a "mini objective"
- Get as detailed as possible

This is the point where it gets boring and difficult, where most people just go and do what feels the best in the moment.

We are men and we plan our actions and not act on impulse

# 3. Identify the required causes and effect patterns to reach those checkpoints

- What are the **causes/requirements** for this desired "effect"?
- What do **they** **need** **to** **think/feel/do**?
- What **you need to do**?
- The **more detailed** and specific you are here **the better**. Ambiguity is what kills plans 

The specificity part is also one what is nitty and gritty but the more detailed you get the better results you are gonna get


## 4. List out any assumptions or unknowns

- Do you **not know the required causes** for any of the effects you need?
- What are the **assumptions** you are basing your plans on?
- **Who can** you have **review your plan** to reveal the things you don't know you don't know


# 5. What the the crucial challenges/problems that could defeat you?

- Every plan has its weak points
- Find yours and compensate for them
- "Pre post mortem" analysis

Post mortem = When a big business fails. They do a meeting and ask themselves: "Why did we fail"

Pre post mortem = Imagine in advance what are the ways I could fail


Examples:

"I don't do enough outreach till the deadline and don't get the client in time"

"My emails get marked as spam and they don't reach the prospects"

## Identify your weak points and guard against them so they can't attack them

## 6. Make a list of your resources

- Use what you've got
- Are you bringing all your weapons to the fight?

Think about most outrageous resources you might have and link them together.

"even a friendship in the kindergarden counts"

## 7. Calendar Time

- List out the specific tasks you must do
- Allocate time and a deadline for each
- Allocate EXTRA time/effort for each because of entropy (better to overwork, if think you need 100 outreach, do 300)
- Identify the key metrics you must track and standards for each.

## 8. Carry out your plan

- You should know what you need to do each day
- Hold yourself accountable
- Evaluate your daily outcomes against your plan
- Adjust your plan as you encounter new facts about reality (ex. bad niche --> need to go back checkpoints)


Static plan = worthless, needs to be adaptive, living and transforming, 


## ~~Optimism or Pessimissim~~ Realism

- Be pessimistic about the truth and the plan
- Be optimistic about the work you are doing

So things about the worst reality possible and be positive about you being able to overcome it.
