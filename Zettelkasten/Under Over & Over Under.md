- Many times mistaken to Head & Shoulders and Inverse H & S

They look the same to the untrained eye

Why Under over is possibly better is because it includes MSB so neckline is broken before RS is made = Can enter at a better price

##### Same Under over but slightly different with candles:

- Using wick instead of candle close for low 

because the point of 1. and 2. is to trap traders and traders dont put stop losses on candle closes, they put SL usually below the wicks
