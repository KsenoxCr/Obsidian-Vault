You have to learn how to orient your self in a difficult enviroments

## How to identify the unknowns and assumptions

- "Foggy" parts of the map ahead. Checkpoints and tasks you don't know yet
- If you've never been there or done it before, there are going to be things you don't know...
- Essentially everything is an assumption/unknown

## Preemptively solve the unknowns you can

 - Consult "maps" review notes and course materials. (google)
 - Talk to people who have been there before or are there now
 - **Identify the most likely possibilities, prepare for all**
 - Quick "Leader-s Recon"
 - But don't worry about tiny stuff. you can figure out when you get there (don't be a geek)

## Risk Determine Testing Strategy

- Are opportunities scarce or infinite? (ex. small vs large market)
- What are the upsides and downsides of getting it wrong?

## If scarce and/or big downsides...

- Measure twice and cut once
- Research and modelling take on greater importance
- Find creative ways to test your assumptions before you begin

Ex. On clients copy = can clients burn entire audience

## If abundant and low downside

The most common situation

- "Recon By Fire"
- AB Test
- Faster you can test new variations
the faster you'll find what works

Ex. On outreach copy = can fail much

Test post with specific need --> no answers = not 



## The Scientific Method Is Your Friend

Scientific method = almost like OODA Loop

This works for marketers really well:

"Is the audience interested in this"

"Is the strategy good"

### Create one "perfect" version --> test and iterate until you got the actually "perfect" version and then launch it to 

Ex. 100-500 people test --> better 

If you launch it to everyone and it's bad --> burned through whole audience

Control & Test -> Control wins -> scramble test -->



Change one variable at the time until you get time the outcome you want
