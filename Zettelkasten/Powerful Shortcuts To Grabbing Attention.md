## Shortcut 1. Talking as a LEADER

Leader = Authority = Trust


If you are seen as the **leader of the pack**

you are most likely gonna lead them to food, shelter, mating opportunities...
and help avoid threats like attacks

People like **supercars** 

why? 

bc they link to affluence, security, status...
### Shortcut 2. 


Leverage the already prebuild associations of the opportunities and threats in their mind to bring them to their attention
