7.5/10.  Woke up 2 hours late cause forgot to put silent mode off...

Again the fucking breaks, now it was because I didn't look at the daily list often enough. Went to sleep too late

Made a mistake with airdrop farm cause didn't think enough before acting. When there is a task/microtask which I haven't done before, Need to pause for few seconds and think it through and think few steps ahead, with everything so that I don't make novice mistakes that easily avoided cause I am really conscious about them but I act impulsively.

Use Timers For G Work Sessions (no time to worry that way)
