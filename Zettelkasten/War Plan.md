## Reasons



















# Root reason for the bad habit

trauma —> bad emotional control

1. Bad emotional control
2. Loneliness
3. stress

### #1 Bad emotional control

Reason: use of porn since the age of 13 -> now, cowardness

Porn = makes it worse

#### Solutions (Hardest to easiest):
- Learn how to **accept the urges** as external emotions getting used to not acting. 
- **Realizing** in the moment that **it will make it worse** after watching
- **Think** about the what porn is **doing to you** and the ones acting in it
- Imagine your future paths based on your actions nöw, cuz todays actions are tomorrows actions (habits)
- **Find something to do** where you have to focus on until the urge goes away
### #2 Loneliness

Reason = ~~not interacting with people~~ Porn

Porn --> lower dopamine levels and confidence --> antisocial --> Loneliness --> Porn...
#### Solutions (Hardest to easiest): 
- **Accept** that you are feeling lonely 
- **Call a friend** or relative to speak about anything
- **Watch** nofap video and eat

### #3 Stress

Reason = ~~stressful life~~ Porn

Yeah, my life style might be stressful but the porn is making it much worse

Just this one easy, instant gratification, dopamine sucker habit will drop down your standards
and keep you from reaching the potential spartan's warrior willpower and the 200 IQ M-O-N-E-Y game that lies within you!

Without any external rewards you will keep to get a dopaminic reward purely from the process and acts themselves. 

But... a HUGE but..

Porn absolutely **destroys** this precious state of improvement and makes it harder to concentrate 
on the things you truly, deeply in your soul, want to do

and it makes it laughably easy to fall into other sources of "cheap happiness" that can't even truly penetrate the shield of radical thoughts anymore, which is good.

that's why your hope should not be lost, infact there only one way to go from here
and it is to WIN. 



"Watching porn is like feeling pleasure from taking 2 sizes too small, agonisingly rubbing shoes of after hours of wearing them and then just to putting them back on right after." -EasyPeasy Method 

You think:
	Watch Porn --> stress relief

but actually:
	Watch Porn --> moves stress to the side  --> Stop Watching Porn --> stress comes back MORE powerful --> Watch Porn...

#### Solutions (Hardest to easiest): 
- **Meditate** 
- **Read Book**
- Go outside and have **fresh O2**


# NEVER PEEK! (or touch yourself AT ALL)

JUST ONE PEEK OR TOUCH CAN TRIGGER A CHAIN OF EVENTS LEADING TO DOOM!

Just one peek can end up you in the vicious cycle of what I call "PSBL"

1. Peek
2. Sneak
3. Beat
5. Leak

Its starts with just one tiny decision and in a blink of an eye you've emptied the full mag of . 

On every single thing you do, no matter how tiny it feels

these tiny decisions roll up into larger ones

how this for an evening:

working hard --> feeling stressed --> distracting questioning though --> reddit
--> nsfw reddit post --> scrolling nsfw posts --> pornhub --> 10 tabs of embarrassingly
disgusting coomer-content that would fry occasional wankers brain into dust. 

or doing research --> opening social media apps --> see a sex bomb looking girl, and another
one, and another one --> suddenly the search bar "magically" opens and and your left hand 
teleports to your crouch --> These's no turning back, you think --> 1 hour later with the same old 10 tabs in front of you, eyes eyes, wondering, why am I **yet again** back it this hellish swamp. 

## From Morning Plan

" Edged for hour and felt miserable and down after (as one should). With every decision I make, I HAVE TO have in mind, constantly, who do I wanna be (superhero) and for me what works best, who do I don't want to become (willpowerless fatass npc low testo sheep).  

Also need to realize not only my triggers but my triggering times like after workout when I have before made excuses like: "It's a reward for training so hard..."

And went the urges come, take them like any other urge, like urge for drugs. It's the devil trying to harm me. And remember how proud would will be when you fight and resist the urge and make the enemy (urge) weaker. If you give in, it will just get stronger

Motivating thought: Even when feeling "bad" emotions (which is just feedback) and really want to rub one out or casual fuck, realize who are you:

you're: OBSERVER AND MASTER OF YOUR THOUGHTS

your thoughts are not you. If you control them, acknowledge bad ones and don't grab them and bend them to your advantage, they can also be tools.

Want to fuck --> can't fuck in the moment --> feel frustrated

Old loser me: rub one out

Current winner me: realize that frustration is energy and use that energy to work even harder and do some pushups and hit the weights 

also remember always that when you delay the gratification, its gonna FEEL SO MUCH BETTER the more you delay it. "
