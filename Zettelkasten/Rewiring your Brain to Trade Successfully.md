One trade has no bearing on the next trade

Trade in a vacuum. 

Like Michael Jordan or Tiger woods, they took it one shot at a time and new it was a numbers game

Don't let the baggage of previous trades affect the next one (just like with life in general)

Think your self as a scientics, journalist, researcher who's conducting a  sample size of trades --> You're hardwiring yourself to focus on the process and not the outcome

In sports: 

One game is irrelevant in the context of a season

But every game is the most important game of their life 



You can only live in the moment

Always remember that it is never life or death with one trade

Amateur
- focus on single trades
- ego driven
- want to be right
- Fear of losing
- live or die every trade

Professionals 
- focus on series of trades
- wealth driven
- want to make money overtime
- Can make money when losing --> No fear of losing

Fuck right and wrong. There's is only execution

Obsession about knowing what will happens next is how both fear and euphoria manifests

Focus first on mastering you , your own emotions before diving in to the more complex tactics

Right: You choose a decision where second and third order consequences are good even at the sacrifice of first one being bad

Wrong: You choose the best decision based on its outcome, not its consequences


for example:

Not talking to girl so you don't get embarrassed,

might be thinking that was good decision as you avoided failure, embarrasement


but


better would be to talk to that girl, fuck it up --> desensitized to embarrassement and learn what to avoid and how to talk better with girls

When pumping, you have to ask yourself:
- I don't sell + He doesn't sell = Both get richer
- I sell + He doesn't sell = he gets richer & I get poorer

Have to remember that people are irrational when it comes to money

in heat of a bull market, they don't think, what if he sells



Price moves really often in parabolic like in the pic.

That's because:

- When price is going up: people are greedy --> don't want to sell
- When price is going down (bleeding): people are fearful, don't want to buy

You need to **trade the people, not the price**

As most of the players in the market are playing on their self interest

you need to play based on others interest and counter-trade that

Trends exists cause people are not good at pricing markets


We all, even the best, feel emotions when trading, its human nature

Professional are just more aware and counter trade these emotions (when there's positive EV)


When you (above average trader) feel like it's too late to buy, most of the traders (dumb money) thinks that way too, so it probably isn't

This is a trader. Investors have to anticipate, traders react

![[Pasted image 20240215020923.png]]

You want to counter trade the bad traders in the market that trade based on emotion

"Red candles cause PTSD, Green candles cause amnesia"

![[Pasted image 20240215021808.png]]

This is how you process and react to news, events etc.

known unknown (buy the dip)

Examples of known unknown: 

Federal Reserve:
- We know what it is
- But don't know what's gonna come out of it

Buy cause everone is anticipating (in the short term, days)

China banning crypto
- We understand it, we know china does this
- Don't know when gonna release or the intricacies


Example of Unknown unknown:

Covid (black swan event)

# **Think Like a Whale**

You can either:

- think like a pleb: battle the whale

- or thing like a whale: battle the pleb

for 1 whale --> 100 000 fish

in the pic, on the green line: Price always moves through the books, the **area of least resistance** until it reaches an area where it is met with **willing buyers** and/or **unwilling sellers**


"Buyers want to buy, sellers dont want to sell" is especially true in crypto, cause it so one sided market (95% long only bias)

The retail traders, pleb are coming to crypto giving away their hand (poker example)

They come in trying to find opportunities to buy



when 95% want to buy a coin,

the 5% (delta neutral traders: whales, market makers) have to provide the liquidity on the other side (sell) 


When you are buying some coin thinking its undervalued and it could go 100x or even just 10x, 

the other side to think that it has no change of going up and most often they think it will go down



The traditional high volume on support trend and low volume means that trend is weak, does not work in crypto

Many things make volume not that accurate in crypto as it is not regulated, for example: exchanges using bots to create fake volume so people trade on their platform more

In crypto spoofing happens a lot so **low volume moves** are actually indicitive of a **continuation**. 


In crypto books, the order in the middle aint really moving the price

So instead of aggressive buying and selling, it's people moving their offers that is moving the price much more

People move sell orders higher --> less resistance --> price move higher

Also limit chasing moves the price up cause there are a lot of buyers below and sellers above keep moving the price higher

so

**Price is moving on low volume cause:** ~~People are coming in to trade~~, market is moving the resistance higher and higher


High volume = passive players /whales) coming in

Tops and bottoms are created by them


Demand creates supply, not the other way around



When whales see capitulation, they come in, buy and let the price come back up

so if you want to trade with whales, you:

1. Open a position at the high volume capitulation
2. Ride it up on low volume momentum 
3. exit on a high volume spike


at 2: need to monitor the price moving easily, with the volume is 1/3 or 1/4 of the bottom where it turned. If so, good, keep position. 

When volume goes up to 3/4 of what it was at the bottom, that's the market telling you, people are willing to trade here (sell on an up move), so exit

Retail traders think that the data they are given is worth shit, it isn't 


the Sun Tzu quote means: In war don't telegraph and show your move, hide it and be unpredictable.

So why do so many people think looking at order books is useful...


It's is, but only to know what is real and what is spoofing



"You see what they want you to see" = Order Books



Huge nukes, dips in crypto are from whales taking off their spoof orders so there is no support and the price crashes down (or they have put a massive market selling order)

Also price can move up with spoofs. As price comes down to the spoof order and there isnt enough buyers to go through it, the price will bounce back up and then whale can move to spoof order up and up as price moves up



How to trade a spoof (not a strategy, but indicator)

Spoof Bid:

- If price is sitting at the bid for too long
- Price is hovering around that level

--> Short or get out of long (whale is gonna take out the bid and price is gonna crash)


There are ways of buying without leaving footprint

and whales are much smarted than retail


so they are not putting up these orders out of carelessness, they want you to see it

![[Pasted image 20240215193100.png]]

Whales create the narrative for the masses to follow

they buy coin --> announce it --> gives coin a boost --> start shilling and interacting on twitter 


Trade to pleb's biases


Whales always know the market sentiment

They know that people think bitcoin is going to 60k so they give people what they want to see, which is price moving up

but ofc whale game is to rug before that


Always question yourself and go back and ask: "Why do I hold this belief"


You as a professional trader, need to:

- Not forget the past
- assume that people are gonna fuck up the same way as in the past

 Chart is not gonna look alike, but human behaviours and emotions are (top = euphoria, bottom = fear)

Don't let yourself be spyop'd to think that price needs to move as soon as you sell/buy it


Usually the think that people expect the least will happen cause that is what fucks up most of the people 


Psyops are carefully created brainwashing

Whales are subverting you with programming to make you feel as if the opinions you hold and the actions you take are your own, when in fact they have been assigned to you

"Buy the dip" -psyop by whales

with fake account, themselves posting, bots

"If I am buying the dip, who selling it to me and millions of others?" hmmmm


buy when others are forced to sell on a liquidation --> unwilling seller, more likely to be right that price is going up


common Psyops:

- Diamond hands

- Cheap coins (they are not cheap. when up 1000x so -50x doesn't mean shit)

- News events (whales know them days/weeks ahead) there is no such thing as insider trading in crypto as it is completely unregulated

G's I need your help to decide on what to prioritize and improve my plan


I live in Finland and am in online school for web development. In Finland students get benefits for studying and am living through those. I am really passioned about programming and my mind is kinda wired for it as a learn concepts naturally and quickly. 

I know Tate preaches that you don't get rich with passion but doing the things that others don't want to do and solve their problems. 

But I truly believe that I could make pretty big wealth in the long term in this industry by working with starts ups and getting paid by their stocks and when I'm at that level, team up with other devs to build apps/SaaS/dev tools that can bring huge value to people --> get paid well. 

I know building a business or copywriting would bring a lot more money short term but I have my always life been a tech guy and have tried copywriting and dropshipping but it always felt like I was swimming up the current. And I know I know learning new, hard things always have friction and I would get better at them overtime but I still thing I should utilize thing skill that I am already good at.

So my plan is to finish school in one year and find a remote web dev matrix job and then move abroad to a cheaper country with less taxes so it's easier to compound capital. Meanwhile I am gonna learn trading and farm airdrops on the side. I focus on crypto at night and and code at daytime. I am gonna learn new coding concepts by making own projects that I will monetize --> learn and earn. 
   
So G's tell me if you see any gaps in my plan and and how would you fix them? I see the biggest problem now being no cashflow to fund future trading.

I cant cut time from crypto as I need to focus on the started bull market. I'm not planning to quit school cause if I would go to entry level 9-5 I would make same net amount. What would you guys do in my situation?
