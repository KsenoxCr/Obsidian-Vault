Best trades you gonna take is when you don't feel like it


Study your emotions

If market is pumping and you feel fomo, 
understand that you could have gone in lower

If the price action seems boring, look into it more. Might it make a big move soon?

The ones **who get the biggest wins**, are the ones **who are in early**, before any big move starts

The ones **who are fearful** and looking for already played out bigger moves, **fomo in** and get small win or **lose** cause they were too late. 

This is why its so **important to journal**, your **opinions**, **thoughts** and **emotions**

When the market looks boring and others are shutting down their screen, look into them even more and think: "Should I be buying now?"

**Price always looks bad before it looks good**

Getting in when it looks bad means when it turns good, you are already in profit



### Build a Long System For When The Market Looks Bad 

Study times when:
- Red days/weeks
- After Crash/Sell off
- big dip (20%)

#### Best Wins will be when you don't want to buy but your system says so


#### Fear U want to buy (not always, but mostly)
