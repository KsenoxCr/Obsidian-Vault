You are consistend with gym so you go everytime as you know great it feels to smash your training sessions

But

You have not yet experienced the great proud feeling of getting all the work done or without fapping for atleast 2 week

so you don't have that memory of it to motivate you

You just gotta push it thought the first time. In my own words "The starting of new thing is always the hardest part"

So when you have done it once

and you are **about to skip a task** or **go fap**, **you don't** cause u know how **GREAT it feels to not** **do it**
