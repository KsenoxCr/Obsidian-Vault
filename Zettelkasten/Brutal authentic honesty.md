If you **always tell the truth** and the readers know you always tell the truth

--> Highly unlikely to not trust you

Claim that is not true --> They will not believe you anymore --> uncredible source



Even if **everything** you say is **true****

but 

they don't believe in one thing

= **you're a liar**, so **can't trust anything** 

## Damaging omissions = Good for trust

if you are honest about something that ain't good (and it doesn't destroy your image)

--> More trust


If are always honest --> they believe you --> they believe what you want them to believe --> they take action
