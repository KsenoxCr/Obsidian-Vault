Michael was an ex recruiter

Rules for CV:

- Don't make it too short or too long (max 2 pages)
- The most important part needs to be on the first lines
- Find exatcly what will you do in the job and talk about that on the first lines
- Tailor the Application for the specific job and dont make it vague (just like in copywriting). Make multiple CVs that are specialized for certain jobs
- If you have done that job task for even one minute in your previous jobs, write that down, the company that is hiring doesnt know whether your were just a "helper boy" or not. It just knowns you have previously done the same task as in their job
- Use AI to find key points that recruiter wants from you 


For the recruiter, the scanning though CVs is the worst part of the day and they just want to get it done, so they don't care about you out of the 1000 applicants. If they see one red flag, they scrap your application
