Only way to claim the success and become successful is to become BOLD 

OODA Loop != Observe Orient Decide Analysize

OODA Loop = Observe Orient Decide **ACT**

You need to ACT 

And even if everyone laughs at you, you go bankrupt, you fail 1000 times in a row, you still have that inner fire of your gonna make it regardless. 

That inner fire needs to be build up overtime through hardship 


## Don't think on the side lines, just ACT 


## I am going to fail many times, but I am going forward nonstop so I am gonna win in the end
