- Trend Lines are NOT MAGIC
- Do Not represent S/R
- Allow to see what other Traders see
- Give great Confluence to Uptrends/Downtrends

### #1 If a trendline respects price action, look for entries on the same timeframe or lower

### #2 If a trend line breaks, take note and become defensive

- When price breaks out the trend line, taking partial profits (i.e 50%) helps to deal with negative emotions as it doesn't always guarantee neutral market phase

### #3 If a steep trend breaks, trade it back to the shallower trend

or begin to exit trade

When steep trend breaks, go to lower timeframes for entries

you have clear target: shallower trend line
