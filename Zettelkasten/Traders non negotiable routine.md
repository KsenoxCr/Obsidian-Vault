You are a trend trader, market is moving sideways and you are waiting for the next up trend. 

#### What are you doing between trends?

You should be becoming better:

Understand better:

-  the market 
-  trending systems
-  yourself & psychology


Fill the time between traders:

- What can I read?
- What can I research?
- What can I 


### The process/routine should be made for your style of trading


Not what Michael says, or what a student says

for YOU


##### I am a **trend trader** so I need to focus on understanding:

- Themes/Narratives
- Everything is gonna go up, but how can I spot what's gonna outperform
- Research different coins
- Overall market = bitcoin & macro
- Cycles = emotional & psychological aspects
- Big trends = social media, twitter, what are people saying
