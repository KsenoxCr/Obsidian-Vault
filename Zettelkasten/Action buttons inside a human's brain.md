One of the main things as a copywriter is:

**Find**, **Trigger** and **Amplify** the readers desires/pains

Many humans are good at **dimming down the dream** when failed trying to achieve it

People find ways to distract them from feeling pains and wanting dream outcomes


#### As a copywriter you need to find these pains & desires and bring them to life

You CAN'T create a pain or desire out of the sky. It needs to already exist or link to existing desire/pain
