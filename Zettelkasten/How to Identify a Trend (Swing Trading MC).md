### All you need for a trend are

- Moving Averages
- Market Sctructure

#### In a trend, there must be hh and hl or lh and ll

- Best entries are on 1H or 4H

but they need to be in the context of HTF trend (1D+)

### signals (first to last):

- 50/100/200 MA are not fast enough to give reliable trend  
reversals on HTF  
- For the same reason, they are great on LTF when already in  
a trend (fewer fakeouts)  
- Daily market structure provides a better signal than  
50/100/200  
- 12/21 EMA bands provide a *faster* signal than Daily MS.  
Faster doesn't always = better

### Higher time uptrend confirmation (1D+)

- On down trend, when 50 crosses 100, it usually is a fake signal

- When 50 crosses on top so EMA are 50/100/200 = Early stage developing trend

- When 50/100/200 all slope up = Uptrend
- 200/100/50 all slope down = Downtrend

#### As Swing trader, 12/21 Bands are not your entry signal

- They are your early trend identifier

You use 12/21 to identify a possible trend, then you confirm it with BOS (1D) or 50/100/200 (little less risk, little less profit)
