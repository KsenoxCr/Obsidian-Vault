### What is an NFT

A non-fungible token (NFT) is a crypto token that represents a unique asset. Most importantly they are publicly verifiable proofs of ownership and authenticity on the blockchain. Everyone can publicly see that the asset is the original and it belongs to a certain person.

Put it simply the main features of an NFT are publicly verifiable:

- Non-fungible (unique)
- Proof of originality
- Proof of ownership

Since it is non-fungible every token is unique and not interchangeable with any other token of the same kind. A non-fungible example from real life is a piece of real estate or a basketball card.

Individual units of fungible assets on the other hand are interchangeable as all of them are worth the same. A good fungible example is the USD. It doesn’t matter which $100 bill you own, one is not better than the other.

### Token protocols

Just like fungible tokens, the non-fungible tokens also have protocols to standardize NFT’s and provide interoperability. This helps with transferring the assets between decentralized applications.

The main non-fungible token protocols on ethereum chain are ERC-721 and ERC-1155. All you have to know is that the new NFT’s you look at always should use the currently mainstream protocols to be able to interact with other applications on chain.

### Main use cases

There are several use cases and after listing them below we will go through them one by one.

- PFP/Brand - Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC)
- Art - Fidenza
- Gaming - Axie Infinity
- Utility for decentralized apps - Genesys Go

Other use cases will be showing up soon as the industry is getting mainstream. Everything that needs a proof of ownership and uniqueness make a good use case for NFT’s.

### Value of NFT's

An NFT like everything else that has value in this world has to have desirability (symbol, utility) and be scarce. NFT's can give you status like other brands by reaching a symbol state. Everyone knows Gucci or Ferrari. We desire it to gain more status.

Uniqueness is one form of scarcity. Uniqueness comes from limited numbers.

Limited numbers come from capping the collection (10,000 BAYC) and/or adding different tiers/traits to the collection (laser eyed BAYC). Not everyone can have the best ones. Besides that BAYC has a collection limit of 10,000.

There is never gonna be more original BAYC unlike new Rolex’s that are produced each year.

### PFP (Brand/Status symbol)

A PFP is valuable because it’s a flex and conveys status. A Gucci bag is a flex. You can signal to the world that you can afford it hence you are higher value. Why can you flex with a Gucci bag? Because it became a symbol and everyone recognizes the brand. Symbols rule the world.

There is no bigger flex than buying something totally useless for a ton of money. This is why celebrities are buying BAYC.

### Art

Art is of course more abstract than other use cases.

Besides the aesthetics, flexing is also super important here. There is only one institution in this world who has the real Mona Lisa.

In general most of the artists drop smaller collections and 1/1's, so these can be harder to obtain.


### Gaming

Gaming is one of the biggest industries.

In the gaming industry you can’t really own an asset as it’s the property of the game makers and they could take it from you if they decide so.

With NFT’s and blockchain users can own their gaming assets and with the development of the metaverse they will be able to transport their assets between games.



### Utilites

This is a bit broader and the list of utilities can get long.

A simple utility would be the representation of ownership. Which could mean if you hold an NFT you get revenue share for instance.

It could also be a pass to get access to information or social circle.
