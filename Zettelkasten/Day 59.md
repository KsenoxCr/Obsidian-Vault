6/10. Was at parents so didnt get much done today. Watched adult pics and came and as usual felt like shit for doing that and make things worse. What I learned is to never peek and if I impulsively peek as it happens when trigger occurs without notice

cut the action before it suck me down it to the deep dark black hole. Its the easiest to stop at the the beginning and gets more difficult to quit and come back the longer I stay watching

Used time well on train watching lessons. Focusing was harder but it was due to meal with pasta. 

Spent too much time talking to Miguel being nice but wasting both of our time by asking questions I already knew answer to just to keep the convo going. Next time ask more specific and useful question and dont waste time on graphs. And say immediately if you already know some topic.
