Here is a great example of why not to panic sell and why you must follow your system religiously:

![[Pasted image 20240505024412.png]]


-Should I avoid boxes where there are false breakouts to the opposite side

![[Pasted image 20240426011259.png]]



-Could this count as BOS?

![[Pasted image 20240120003640.png]]

G's I have sometimes trouble identifying trend leg. In my understanding a trend leg is from hh to hh or lh to lh (swing). On the pic i've identified the obvious trend legs but what about the BOS(s) in the white circle

MSB != BOS 

  

because BOS means continual of momentum and on MSB the direction of momentum changed so it isn’t continuing in the same direction.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

G’s, Which one here is the correct MSB? IMO 1 bc it still barely makes a new HH so its the last swing low before the reversal. I need a confirmation so I don’t learn the wrong way.

Is there a MSB or BOS(s) in between:

MSB? 

  

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/9kpLYJKfVHrtIOo8mbuaDVPcl6908mLoCZ7UFGq7UplzoVfjkrZUyOJ7ka_xSfplTyNTN2UANm_Gh45o2r5TmpTacvJV1wolYD1ti470vKTXe9mbAyh__kXIqeec36HBA8EQEccUhzeBTlcnjlAQtsQ)

  

Do I have to wait till one of the levels is broken (BOS or MSB) or is there other way to confirm MSB where there a huge trend leg 

  

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/0Y2RfA9Bbm-jpZgTxHaa1PUuKmDonqtz2WiPaXgJGJlsKAt2aHEN5wCy3ffRvGvM6zO3i5P1tnWe6Xws49H9At2LIQgS5tMLxK_iUtKPcNqj15DYjyU-PLZT97tNcSyZ-uxCLO5a50LiMUeRDNrw2-o)

  

Is every Higher High or Lower Low a Break of Structure (BOS)?

  

Are the Range Low and High, MSB and BOS Correctly marked?

  

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/L6yY-ZcnUzQbBk9Ntiwqa-OldzvjEhXz_VkbYUZg_qJ7Ci4P1zLeXeyHkXO7U5FCINjpbdBT5M3KWCMFvizx-5Ojs5DzpnKzfiK0GmobbfWhhjswQjY5e4qOSSv4c6Uuh0AP27nwQhlAL3P7dcbGYng)

  

Can this be a MSB and BOS:

  

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/oXRg4nCKbWeie-aT2nd7YhapOb-hJf-f5WtCun55zhTDMyqTavB0VzLhE0Czy2lfXKEf5WBTk2Dm73eK8wY4fyb54hyCObKpmt4XYGUH5tcXRHIastFAR5C2vIDqTtb6DlIXPB1p4ATiKWxJ-BunGfg)

Cause If it is BOS, then:

If it just MSB and the second leg is

![[Pasted image 20240120011121.png]]

MSB before closing through VWAP but is it valid when the VWAP resetted



![[Pasted image 20240127013508.png]]

What are the chances :D

![[Pasted image 20240127013544.png]]

Cant be serious right now :D 

Could I be doing something wrong or the ruleset/system just that bad :D

![[Pasted image 20240128023818.png]]

Strategy: FOMOing in on huge pumps and dumps after the first candle to get small wins cause they usually don't immediately retrace back

![[Pasted image 20240127014545.png]]

Where is the MSB in this? these two pics

![[Pasted image 20240128022345.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240128024943.png]]

How can i know if high is truly swing high on real time so that I can mark msb and bos on the HTF bc there are countless of small msb and bos that do not matter as I'm trading HTF so how can I recognize which one is useless and which one is not when is real time and don't have confirmation if its just a swing or trend shift



Two Questions regarding backtesting rules for 12/21 EMA as trend shift confluence tool. 

Is the stop loss on the correct level as my rules say "Above/Below the candle prior to the EMA cross". I see that its the candle high/low that goes though the EMA.  

I know that I take profit on the opposite msb but what about if the opposite msb happens on the loss side. Michael always says to NEVER move stop loss (if not experienced using pyramiding or something...) 

so should I wait it to go to the SL even though there was an opposite msb before that or can I cut the trade on the candle close confirming opposite msb?

It seems like it doesn't really matter on the backtesting sheet as it always says -1 on losses but it does matter when trading for real as it lowers the potential losses.

![[Pasted image 20240128201343.png]]


#### Price came back to the same strong level with the same kind of path

![[Pasted image 20240130020810.png]]


What happened here???

![[Pasted image 20240131015026.png]]

Are these correct? When should i change the range low/high?

![[Pasted image 20240210021429.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240211014541.png]]

AVA 5M too low timeframe for confirming msb


## Range Trading Questions

- Is the MSB nesessary?
- Can 75% Retracement also be against the trend. like here?
![[Pasted image 20240213021712.png]]

- Michaels lessons confusing. On other he says to count the leg from swing low/high and in other he says interim low/high
- Low time frame with low liquidity coins a problem? where there cant be a tiny move above the range low or high to get in after. like on the pic up the move under has to be like 1/6 the size of the range itself


Does this count as a bos trade when there's msb that doesnt create trend shift?

![[Pasted image 20240216014131.png]]

My setup is bos with 3 x moving average volume so it doesnt happen that often




Is this considered a retest

![[Pasted image 20240218022109.png]]

Would you guys count this as retest

![[Pasted image 20240218023715.png]]

G's would you count the red line as msb. Its easy to say in hindsight it was just part of the consolidation but in real time 

![[Pasted image 20240218023944.png]]

But in live trading its completely differenet situation. but the red line is drawn from interim high and not swing high. Its still technically valid msb as it drops makes lh --> hh --> ll. I really struggle with bos and msb as they are somewhat subjective and systems should be purely objective so there should be no room for feeling

![[Pasted image 20240218024127.png]]

Is my system too specific if my setup happens only handful of times in a month and it is a 15min chart. some months only once or twice. And the rules arent even than complicated so quite sure I am just not seeing all the setups.


![[Pasted image 20240222205947.png]]


Remember that these kind of situations will hurt when trading with real money:

![[Pasted image 20240227233416.png]]
# Indicators

- How many EMA bands crossed candles on average confirm trend shift (1 usually on lower timeframes fakes trend shift)
# Swing Trading

#### What if I trade with two Opposite Swing Trading Systems like:

- "False" False breakout, **Box Method**
- Breakout with no retest

- Can box have sloping EMA and not go sideways?

![[Pasted image 20240406140942.png]]

- Do false breakouts to the opposite side of box matter? i.e trading a bullish trend, a box forms but it falsely breakouts to the down side but then reverses back up and breaks out rallying up
- Does timeframe of box matter?
- 30min vs 1H vs 2H vs 4H 12/21 EMA bands for exit
# Questions for Captains

- How would one define past bull and bear markets time periods for backtesting purposes 
![[Pasted image 20240406151243.png]]

- Which one is more valid box and why?

![[Pasted image 20240407141848.png]]
  ![[Pasted image 20240407141815.png]]
  Which wick would you pick as box high and why? First one makes valid setup, second doesnt

What you think about box where there its top is "too high"
