7/10

Wasted quite some time during the day by having too empty schedule.

Also didnt take regular breaks and had too many tabs open to do different things so focus was slices in places.

Didnt push my self to my limits in the gym


Helper cousin to do airdrops but wasted time in the process by not multitasking efficiently

Didnt meditate 

Fucked up timing with test in school as I had booked the nurses appoinment on top of it...
