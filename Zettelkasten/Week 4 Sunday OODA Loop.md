I have the cycle of shaming and punishing my self for not remembering stuff and not being creative and focused enough --> feel less powerful and more "beta" energy --> goes to do "beta"/dopamine draining activities --> More bad short term memory, lack of creativity and concentration for longer periods of time.

So the **Root Cause** is the **dopamine draining activities** themselves

not the feeling of not being good enough. 

I need to always try my best and realize that if I go through the bad times LIKE A MAN:

--> I'll come though **a stronger, smarter and a better person**

and If I don't and fall into **cheap garbage dopamine**: 

--> I'll loose motivation, drive, confidence, time, energy, happiness, 

And don't make it such a big deal

### Need to find the balance between efficiency (speed) and quality

Like on backtesting trading: Should back test with speed or with less speed and trying to analyze the market at the same time. Is it like autopilot task or not

## Low standards in certain parts of life

I have high standards when it comes to hitting the gym, always hard no excuses and always do cardio the amount I said to do prior, always

But I have neglected keeping high standards in other parts of life bc I haven't had good enough of reasons. 

First of all, I haven't seen progress in other things as such as in the gym. I can see my almost greek statue like body in the mirror but can't see a sport/super car in the garage or numbers in the bank to motivate me to **get better** and what **no not lose**. 

I have distracted my self from emotional control with content that I think is useful and productive (and yes it kinda is) BUT i'm not fully listening so its just burdens my mind without actually remembering the useful info I'm hearing. 

Lessons learned:

Victories:

Challenges:
	Have had high standards for myself in few areas in my life but not all and those aspects that I have put lower standards on, have dragged other areas down or atleast supressed my potential powers. 
- Have had hard time working hard on things that I haven't seen progress in. Gym is easy peasy as I can physically see my great physique --> push hard to not lose it and get stronger, bigger. But on other things it isn't always that clear so I have to keep track of progress other ways to keep me pushing forward
- I've "relapsed" into loser activities (fapping and youtube) many times this week that keep me levels down were I could be. I found binaural beats this week and found them to be highly benefitial and can replace YT with them bc YT has for me been purely for more stimulation so I can focus on the task (outside of work) better. 
- For fapping I just first of need to have the reasons deeply inserted in my mind, why I don't do that anymore. The "Why" needs to come from desired identity change. Then just avoid obvious triggers and If it feels unbearable and the excuses start to stack up --> Take a small break and do anything else that doesn't harm me and drain my dopamine storages. 
- Main problem with work has been lack of creativity but that is clearly from the mind poisoning activities I have been partaking which have introduced brain fog and cowardness in my life. If I can be long enough without these things, the delta fosB in my brains starts to reverse and the "safety net" of comforting activities will go a way. So when a problem occurs, instead of first thinking of escaping from it, My mind will first try to solve it. 

### Being too harsh on myself on the things that it is anti useful
