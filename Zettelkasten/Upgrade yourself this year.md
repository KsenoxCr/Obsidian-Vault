If you all times do things right, you want to do everything right in every aspect of your life.

Best time management in trading is not to watch every daily candle move when your just holding coins. 
Instead

You need a fulfilling hobby/work so you get better in the mean time in other devours and overall better man PLUS you don't have time to fuck yourself up in the markets by "clicking buttons"

Winners in trading:
- Have a life outside of charts 
- Don't focus too much on learning TA but on mindset and how to make decisions
-
