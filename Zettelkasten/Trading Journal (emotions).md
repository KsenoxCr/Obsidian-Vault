## 01.05.24

#### Exit: swap all BTC to USDT (binance)

###### Reasons:
1. MSB and BOS to the opposite side
2. Michael G says this is bearish, possible few months of bad price action
3. Weekly candle is about to break 21 band, 
4. Fed claiming to calm down the printing (sauce: Daily levels)
5. Daily 12/21 has been Red for 18 days
6. Price gone sideways, funding rate elevated

###### Risk:

 - Exiting all

###### Emotions:

- Feeling quite confident that price has already formed a local top and has already switched to bearish trend 
- Small fear of this being a false breakout and then I miss on the next big leg of HTF uptrend

##### Paths:

- **Red** (bad): Price reverses and breakouts out bearish

- **Blue** (neutral): Price jumps back up a little but fails to come back to the range, starts bleeding until finds level that holds aka bottom, ranges there, then starts the next cycle of bull run

-  **Green** (good): Price nukes down to the bottom level, ranges there gathering energy to push to new ATH again

## 
### Entry: Swap USDT back to BTC

- When price has found "bottom" and daily 12/21 flip green

bottom = price has formed a range and a support level that it doesnt want to break through

Example from 2021 Bull Run:
