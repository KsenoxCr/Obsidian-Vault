#### Next thing in the Persuasion Cycle

is

## 1. Revealing the RoadBlock(s)

## 2. Show the Solution

The actions they need to make in order to achieve their success

Actions to get to the dream outcome

## 3. Frame the Product/Action/deliverable... 

as the **BEST vehicle** to getting to the dream outcome.

- How the actions they're gonna take are gonna overcome their 
problems (roadblocks) to get to where they want to be
