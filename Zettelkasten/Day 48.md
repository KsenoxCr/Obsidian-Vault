9/10. Really good day. Did tasks on time and focused much better than other days. by focus I mean focusing on the actual task instead of worrying about being the best, training, not being good enough etc. so mental game was better

Wasn't feeling training but still pushed trough with 80% intensity. Could have used supersets  much more though. 

Again time going to sleep was stretched to 2 am but no need to wake up early so not detrimental mistake.  

Stroked after gym but managed to not fap with is great! This was accomplished by breathing more deeply and thinking about the pleasure being just for few secs max mins and visualizing the shame, the guilt and the down feeling afterwards. "You are gonna regret it. If you feel bad now, Imagine how bad you will feel after the wank"
