#### What is it?

Traders who have shorted a coin are forced to buy it back at a higher price than they sold it for

### Why does it occur? 

There is a sudden increase in demand for the coin, causing its price to rise sharply

Avoid trading when price is fluctuating alot and doesn't need a lot of effort to move the price, when there is low resistance ([[Path of least resistance]])

Trade when price is moving one direction because big moves are harder to stop. that's because when people (traders) starts doing something (buying/selling), they want to keep doing that until something significant happens that makes them have to change course

**Trade Titanic, Don't Trade Jetskis**


### Why trade a short squeeze?

- Price is unstoppable = free money trade

###### Why do they work?

- Nobody wants to sell
- Bulls are buys because price goes up
- Bears are buying because they're being forced to close at a loss
- Liquidation engines add support to the move

##### Once it ends...

###### There is a a sudden decrease in demand for the coin, because:

- Bulls want to take profit
- Bears have been fully liquidated
- Liquidation engines have no more work to do

This = **MEAN REVERSION**
