### **Intro and goals**

Many protocols/chains distribute free tokens to their active community members to increase their project’s visibility, and incentivize early adopters. These free token distributions are commonly known as airdrops.

**Your goal for the Airdrop course:**

Right after finishing this course, the "Airdrop Steps" course will unlock. Follow the steps there and setup your chain airdrop farms. You will also gain access to channels where airdrop steps are listed.

Also make sure you setup your protocol farms (✍️ | daily-task-list channel).

After the Airdrop course:

After setting up your airdrop farms, you can get started with DeFi and Bull Run courses.

You can always ask questions and get the latest updates in airdrop-chat.

## **What is an airdrop?**

Many protocols/chains distribute free tokens to their active community members to increase their project’s visibility, and incentivize early adopters. These free token distributions are commonly known as airdrops.


### **What does farming the airdrop mean?**


It basically means that you are actively doing transactions and tasks over a longer period of time.

Transactions can be bridging, providing liquidity, swapping coins, buying NFT's, or any other on-chain activity.

Other tasks involve connecting your addresses and socials to different websites and discords, so activity can be proven.

### **Team's interest**

The team behind the protocol/chain doesn't want to make you rich. Their interest is making themselves and their investors rich. Many projects are also avoiding SEC interference by ditching token sales for airdrops.

They want the token price to go up both in the short run (they play the airdrop with many addresses) and the long run as well (when their vested tokens unlock they get super rich).

They will distribute just enough tokens to the community members so they can dump on them.

### **How much capital you need**

You can get started with around $50 if you farm one airdrop with one address.

If you farm more airdrops with more addresses then of course this can go up much higher.

Some people do these plays with a 10-100 addresses.

### **How long until you make money?**

Once the team announces the airdrop people will start farming the airdrop. Over a long enough time period people get bored/lazy and stop farming the airdrop.

That's good for the team as they have to distribute fewer tokens, so it's worth waiting for them to release the token.

This means airdrop plays can last from a few weeks to over a year.

In the meantime though you might qualify for smaller airdrops within the ecosystem, so you have to keep an eye out for updates.

### **How much can you make?**

It depends on the play but 10-30x is very normal.

If someone farmed the Arbitrum airdrop for half a year with an initial cost of $50 then that person most likely (depends on the exact activities) made around $1400 at token release.

That is almost a 30x.

If someone had played with more addresses then of course the payoff was bigger as well.


### **Time commitment**

Once you have your setup usually you have to spend 5-10 mins a week on one address for one play.

If you farm several airdrops with several addresses then of course it can be much more.

### **Setup and play**

There is an initial setup to the play. This involves adding new addresses, sending money on-chain, getting familiar with the protocols, etc. If you have been doing things on-chain before then this will be simple.

Once your setup is done it becomes grinding. You will have to take the same actions weekly for a longer period of time. The steps are very simple in most cases.

### **Why it is harder than it looks**

Uncertainty. When it comes to these plays your brain is your biggest enemy. You can't know when the airdrop will happen. Maybe a few weeks from now or maybe a year from now.

Working for something without being sure you get the reward anytime soon for it can be hard.

You don't have to have experience or be smart to play the airdrop game. You need discipline and you need to be able to handle uncertainty. The actions that you have to take are simple but boring and they require consistency.

# **Team's interest**

You have to understand how the team makes money, so you understand their motivation.

Their interest is to make themselves and the VC's rich. They have no interest in making you rich. They need average users (you) to dump the tokens on.

They want the token to reach a high price both in the short run (they will play the airdrop with many addresses) and the long run as well (when their vested tokens unlock they get super rich).

### Token distribution

![[Pasted image 20240209203111.png]]

Startups and web3 companies have vesting schedules, so VC's (venture capital, they are the professional investors who get in early at a good price) can make sure the project will not be abandoned. 

In most cases the timeline is 4 years with a one year cliff. The team and 
VC's get 25% of their shares/tokens after a year (no money in the first year), then the rest is linearly added on a monthly basis.

This means that the team's interest is to create longer term holders, so when they receive their tokens they have someone to dump on. If there is no holders then the project is basically worth 0 and the team doesn't make money.

### **Why does the team do airdrop?**

The team wants to create awareness and true believers, so they distribute tokens to the most active members.

With the airdrop approach they try to increase the chance that people will not sell the tokens right after the airdrop as they believe in the project. This means the team can dump on the users later on.

There are other ways to incentivize usage as well but liquidity farmers for instance tend to be more mercenary.


### How the team wants to distribute the tokens

The team wanna create many believers with a smaller/mid stack (at least a few hunderd dollars).

If they create whales then those will dump the tokens before the team could.

If they only distribute the tokens to a few people then the network effect will be too small.

If the users' stack is too small (less than a few hundred dollars) then the people won't care about the token and price.

### **Timing**

Timing plays a huge part.

Once the team announces there will be an airdrop people will start playing it. Over a long enough period though they get bored/lazy and stop playing the airdrop. That's good for the team as they have to distribute fewer tokens and only to the most active members.

Timing is also important because of Sybil attacks (see later).

### **Timing ll**

The team will hire experts and analyze the on-chain activity of users and hackers.
 
They will decide the timing of the token release based on these activities. They wanna make sure they can identify malicious and lazy users and filter them out.

This is why consistency is important and you have to play the long game.


### **Sybil attacks**

"The Sybil attack in computer security is an attack wherein a reputation system is subverted by creating multiple identities."

Hackers try to take advantage of airdrop opportunities by creating hundreds or thousands of addresses to play the airdrop with. They try to mask their own identity, so the addresses don't seem to be connected.
### **Automated and manual attacks**

Some hackers use automated ways through smart contracts that can be easily executed.

Other ones create a bunch of addresses manually to make sure it's harder to recognize patterns as it is not programmed.

At the end of the day it's the teams responsibility to filter out all kind of attackers.

### **Why is this important?**

The team has to make sure they filter out the Sybil attackers, so no whales will be created.

Whales are terrible for protocols and price action. They are a constant sell pressure and can dump any time. Many projects have been destroyed by whales.

### **How to filter out attackers**

The team needs time and on-chain analysis to see what attackers try to do by recognizing the patterns.

This has a huge impact on the airdrop criteria as the team has to make sure to filter the attackers out. It also has an impact on when the token will be dropped.

On the other hand the team has make sure not to filter out regular users and. This can take time and expertise as it's a hard task to do.

### What does this mean for you?

You have to make sure to do the extra mile with your setup and farming compared to the average user which will protect you from being filtered out.

On the other hand you shouldn't have to do anything too fancy with your setup since the token needs a big enough community and they can't filter everyone out.
Make sure you don't waste any extra money on unnecessary tasks.

### The setup

You have to have a basic understanding of how to play airdrops before you take any actions.

You might already know how to use wallets and protocols but you need a different setup than for usual crypto plays.

You have to implement a clever system, so your activity looks like you are not there just to farm the airdrop but to actually use the network/protocol.

Once you have done your one time setup with each address farming is very easy in terms of complexity.

### The type of plays

In most cases you will farm airdrops on new networks (chains), so you will interact with protocols on that network.

You get paid in the networks upcoming token and you might also get some tokens distributed by the protocols that you use on that chain. An example here is Arbitrum chain and $ARB airdrop.

Sometimes you will use protocols on an older chain that already has a token. In this case you can get the tokens from the protocol's upcoming token launch. An example for this is the NFT marketplace Blur and its token $BLUR.

In some other cases you will do social tasks (posting on twitter) that don't even involve transactions.

### Figure out the steps first

Before you do anything else figure out the exact steps of the setup.

If you screw up in the beginning then there are several issues you can run into:

- Spending more money on getting your money on-chain
- Wasting time
- Getting scammed (clicking on malicious links, etc)
- Possibly not qualifying for the airdrop (you might miss a crucial step)
- Getting disqualified for suspicious activity (Sybil attack, more on this later)

### How much capital do you need?

When you farm airdrops for new chains your largest cost is usually bridging to that chain.

Sometimes you can only bridge from Ethereum, so you have to pay the gas fees on Ethereum with $ETH. Currently the bridging fees should be between $10-$20. This can change over time.

If you can avoid bridging from Ethereum then do so.

On newer chains the transaction fees are neglectible, usually less than $0.1. If you have $30 on the chain that will be enough for quite a long time to do enough transactions.

This means $40-$50 per address should be enough.



If you have more money then I definitely recommend you to play several airdrops with several addresses.

First make sure you play a few airdrops simultaneously. Let's say each airdrop play costs $50 ($20 bridging + $30 on the new network).

You will play 3 airdrops which will cost $150 if you use only one address each.

Then you can increase the number of addresses. You can play all 3 airdrops with 3 addresses. Now your cost will be 3 x $150 = $450.

If you have enough capital and time then I would recommend at least 20 addresses for each play but you can easily go up to a 100 too.

### More addresses with little money

I recommend using more addresses with less money than using fewer addresses with more money.

If you have $200 then farm the airdrop with 4 addresses, each with $50.

If you farm one address only then your volume will be higher but that usually doesn't matter as much as having more activity on several addresses.

**Use new seed phrases/addresses for airdrop farming. DON'T USE your existing accounts that hold your investments.**

### Setting up several addresses

If you wanna use more addresses then you can always add new ones in Metamask or the wallet you need to use for farming.

If you want more than 10 addresses then I would use a new seed phrase.

On one laptop you should be logged in on several Metamask accounts in the 2 recommended browsers. One in Google Chrome and many in Brave. In Brave you can create profiles and attach a separate Metamask login to each.

If you wanna be logged in on more accounts then you should consider an extra laptop. Logging in and out from different Metamask accounts in the same browser is risky as you have to type the seed phrase every time.

You DON'T need hardware wallets for airdrop farming.

If you use 10 addresses per seed phrase as recommended then you won't have more than $500 with that particular seed phrase.





# How to

You shouldn't send money around on the new chain without bridging when you are doing the airdrop farms

Bridging will be one of the criteria

![[Pasted image 20240210160036.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240210160120.png]]

# Recommended Setups

No farming wallet is connected to one source as there are independent CEX address for each one 

![[Pasted image 20240210160220.png]]

With this one, the origin point is even further away

![[Pasted image 20240210160403.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240210160536.png]]

### Combine setups when more addresses

The vertical line = you cross network = bridging

### **How to send money to addresses?**

You can send money to a CEX like Binance or you can send money directly to on-chain addresses with services like Moonpay. Sending money to on-chain addresses depends on your location, so it's your task to figure the rules in your country.

Preferably you can avoid Ethereum chain because the bridging fee is high. If you can bridge from a cheaper chain then do so, but this is not always possible as new chains usually only let you bridge from Ethereum.

### How to distribute money between addresses

You might have limited numbers of CEX's and other services to get your money on-chain. But once your money is on-chain you can always send money from one address to another.

Let's say you send $160 worth of $ETH from a CEX to an Ethereum address. After this you could send $50 to two separate addresses. Now you have $50 worth of $ETH on each (calculating with $5 txn fees for sending money to diff addresses).

You could then bridge to the new network where you wanna farm. Now you have used one CEX but 3 addresses to bridge before starting to farm the airdrop.

If you bridge then it's unlikely that you will get flaged as Sybil attacker but you never know. Always try to err on the side of doing a bit more in hopes of making more money.

![[Pasted image 20240210203915.png]]

### **How much time does it take?**

Farming on one address usually takes like 5 mins on a weekly basis.

Multiply this number by as many address as you have and by the different airdrop plays that you play.

Let's say you farm 3 airdrops, each from 10 addresses. That's 30 airdrop farms to maintain. Weekly, it will take 30 x 5 mins = 150 mins.

### Once your money is there

Once your money is at the right place on-chain you can start doing the airdrop tasks.

You will likely have around $30 in each address. Transactions cost less than $0.1 on newer chains, so you will have enough money to pay for gas fees for a long time.

From this point on you will just have to keep grinding and look for occasional updates for the plays.

## Criteria

After having long enough time to analyze the players the team will come up with a list of criteria to distribute the tokens. This happens in hindsight.

It always involves activities that are connected to chain/protocol usage.

### **Explicit vs implicit tasks**

In some cases what actions the team will take into consideration is more straightforward as the team will give a clear list of actions to take.

If it's not clear then airdrop farmers do what they think will be best. Keep in mind that you wanna get ahead of the crowd in this case by doing a bit more.

### Go the extra mile

Always keep in mind that the team wants to distribute enough tokens to have people to dump on BUT they don't wanna distribute too much.

This means that if you do just a little more than the average farmer then you will get paid handsomely.

### Typical criteria

- Bridging (if new chain)
- Transaction count and frequency
- Transactions over time
- Volume
- Protocols (smart contracts) used
- Social tasks
- Guild activities

### Mainnet vs testnet

Mainnets are live networks that you use on a daily basis (Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc) where real-world value is exchanged. Testnets are parallel networks for testing projects and development with no real-world value.

Sometimes you gotta farm airdrops on testnets as the mainnet is still under development.


### **What tasks should you do?**

Some of the criteria are optional and others can be mandatory. It's up to the team to decide.

Usually you have to reach a minimum number from the listed criteria. Let's say the team decides you have to qualify for 3 of them. E.g. you bridge, you do enough transactions, and you do enough transactions over time.

If you do more tasks and you qualify for more criteria then of course you will get more tokens airdropped.

In some cases there are also tiers within one task. E.g. you need to do at least 10 transactions to qualify for transaction count but if you reach at least 50 then you get more tokens airdropped.

### Bridging

This is an obvious way to filter out Sybil attacks. If there is an address that has never bridged then it is likely a Sybil attacker unless there are some other heavy activities.

You can always try to farm addresses that have never bridged by just sending money there from your other addresses. It only costs time and you might get some extra money. 


### Transaction count

![[Pasted image 20240210231253.png]]

This is basically the number of all the transactions that happened on an address.

If an airdrop will use this as one of the criteria then you could do a 100 transactions in a day and you would pass for that one.

It's much better to do this over time though if possible as transactions over time is almost always one of the criteria as well. This way you don't waste gas fee money. 

### **Transactions over time**

![[Pasted image 20240210231415.png]]

This one is a check for address activity over a longer period of time. It usually happens on biweekly or monthly basis.

This is why you should do a transaction basically once a week per address. With that setup you will qualify both for transaction count and transactions over time.

This is also where most people screw up the airdrop plays. They get lazy and bored and they quit. This step is crucial, so **stay disciplined**.

### **Volume**

![[Pasted image 20240210231526.png]]

This one should be less important.

You should be doing more addresses with little money instead of aiming for large volume with fewer addresses.

Large volume doesn't give you too much advantage because the team doesn't wanna create whales.

On the other hand make sure your volume is around at least $100 all together over time. Many Sybil attackers do many small transactions (< $0.1) to fake activity. If you are doing $20 token swaps for transactions you should be fine over time.

### **Volume vs Number of Addresses**


### **Protocols used**

This can be checked by the number of smart contracts used by an address.

Make sure you use several protocols over time.

One week you might swap $ETH for $USDC on one DEX like Uniswap and then next week you swap $USDC for $ETH on a different DEX.

There are many other things that you can do as well. The point here is that you should be doing transactions on different platforms.

![[Pasted image 20240210232608.png]]

This can be checked by the number of smart contracts used by an address.

Make sure you use several protocols over time.

One week you might swap $ETH for $USDC on one DEX like Uniswap and then next week you swap $USDC for $ETH on a different DEX.

There are many other things that you can do as well. The point here is that you should be doing **transactions on different platforms**.

### Social accounts and tasks

This is usually connected to Discord and Twitter activities.

With Discord you will have to connect your address to your discord account. This is a good way to filter Sybil attackers as it's not that simple to register on Discord without proper SIM cards.

Connecting Twitter is another way of making sure Sybil attackers are filtered out as it is painful to create many Twitter accounts and most people are lazy to do so.


### **Guild activities**

A guild is an automated membership management. A project creates some tasks and by completing them you will get roles and based on those roles possibly tokens at the airdrop.

Typical tasks are swapping tokens, bridging, following someone on Twitter, holding an NFT, or holding a certain amount of XYZ token.

You will be authenticated with your Discord account and your wallet address will be connected through Discord.

This is also a good way to filter Sybil attackers thanks to Discord authentication.

### **Mindset**

When it comes to airdrops it's very important to talk about the mindset.

Airdrop tasks are very simple but very boring and repetitive.

Most people won't make money with airdrops because they give it up at some point.

### **Uncertainty**

When it comes to these plays your brain is your biggest enemy. You can't know when the airdrop will happen. Maybe a few months from now, maybe a year from now, maybe never. 

Working for something without being sure you get any reward for it can be hard.

In most cases the airdrop happens at some point because that is the team's interest.

### Consistency

You don't have to have a lot of crypto experience or be super smart to play the airdrop game. You only need to learn the basics.

What you will need a lot is discipline and consistency besides being able to handle uncertainty.

The actions that you have to take are simple but boring.

### Gym

Airdrops are very similar to the gym.

The actions that you take on a daily/weekly basis will be boring and you don't see instant results.

On the other hand if you keep up the good work long enough then you will be paid handsomely just like in the gym.

To make sure you will be paid for airdrops for sure you should be doing 3-4 farms at the same time. In some cases some token does not get released as the team fails to deliver. If you play at least a few it's almost 100% you will get paid.

### **Habit**

If you start doing something your mind and body will adapt and get used to it. If you turn something into a habit then it will be become much easier to be consistent.

Farming the airdrop at the same time every single week is a very good approach to easily maintain consistency.

### Changing up the tasks

One thing you have to pay attention to when you farm the airdrops is that you need to use more protocols over the weeks/months.

One week use one protocol and the next week when you come back to farm the airdrop use another one.

**Keep a log of the farms and their protocols used**

## Arbitrum airdrop

**This airdrop has already happened. You can't farm this anymore. This lesson is for educational purposes. For available airdrop plays check the airdrop channels.**

Arbitrum is an L2 chain. It is a technology suite designed to scale Ethereum. You can use Arbitrum chains to do all things you do on Ethereum — use dApps, deploy smart contracts, etc., but your transactions will be cheaper and faster. It uses an Optimistic rollup that inherits Ethereum-level security.

$ARB airdrop has been one of the largest airdrops ever. We will analyze this as an example.

### **Arbitrum history**

Arbitrum launched in August 2021. It had some hype in the bull market but in the beginning there were not many projects on it, so it was not the main focus of the bull run.

A possible airdrop was announced but no one was farming airdrops at the time as everyone was chasing coins and NFT's.

People started focusing on the airdrop plays after the $OP (Optimism) airdrop in June 2022.

It was called in the TRW as a signal in July 2022.



$ARB was released and airdropped in March 2023.

People who had been farming the airdrop since 2022 July made some insane gains.

The play took 8 months but paid very well.

### Token distribution

![[Pasted image 20240210234527.png]]

11.6% of all the tokens got dropped to early adopters (aidrops farmers and users).

As the charts shows the team and investors get to keep 26.9% + 17.5% = 44.4%. That is a lot but they will unlock slowly. Thanks to that their interest is to create a real ecosystem and users who believe in Arbitrum.

For that they needed to distribute enough tokens, so people actually care about the chain.


After having long enough time to analyze the players the team came up with a list of criteria to distribute the tokens. This of course happened in hindsight.

Bridging, transaction frequency, transaction volume, protocol usage are the main ones but there is more to it. For a better understanding read this article regarding the $ARB airdrop:

https://www.nansen.ai/research/an-on-chain-distribution-model-for-the-arbitrum-community

### $ARB profit calculation

The calculation goes for one address.

**Average fees to bridge to Arbitrum**: $20
**Average transaction cost on Arbitrum**: $0.1
**Bridged amount**: $50
**Profit**: Depending on the activity with low volume ($50) 800-1800 $ARB which is around $1000-$2000 as of now.

By just being consistent you could turn $70 into around $2000 which is around a 30x. You didn't even need skills. All you had to do was to be able to handle uncertainty and to be disciplined.

# **Embrace on-chain activity**

This lesson is different from the previous ones where we talked about chain farming.

Before we focused on long-term systematic airdrop farming with well-known chains/networks.

In this lesson we will focus on more random, short-term and harder to predict airdrops that can happen any time. You will learn how to be active on-chain and get random token drops that are quite frequent during bull run.

### **What is on-chain activity/protocol farming**

On-chain activity means that you are using dApps through your non-custodial wallet (Metamask/Ledger). This can mean swapping tokens, using lending protocols, minting NFT's, etc.

**The quality of the activity matters**. If you just use Uniswap on Ethereum to swap $ETH for $USDC then it's unlikely you get airdrop for that in this Bull Run. People got airdrop for that in 2020 August.

In the upcoming bull market you have to **focus on the upcoming things that have not existed or haven not been focused on.**

### **Why is this happening?**

During Bull Run project/protocol teams try to create a market instantly to gain attention.

With this they can make sure their project gets some early adopters early on in the Bull Run and their protocol will be used throughout the bull run and the token price might skyrocket.

IF they don't do this then they might miss out on a ton of money as users don't discover their protocol.

### Networks vs protocols

The long-term airdrop farms that you learned about in the previous lessons are usually for chains/networks on top of which protocols/dApps are implemented.

These shorter-term, more** random, less predictable airdrops** that we talk about in this lesson are **usually for protocols/dApps** not for chains/networks.

### **Criteria**

When it comes to these plays the **criteria are usually very random**.

If the protocol is brand new and wanna do an instant airdrop then they can't require users to use their own product as it has not been out yet. In this case they usually check on-chain activity on the chain where the protocol is implemented.

If the protocol has been around for a few weeks or months then of course they can reward the users who used their products in the early days.

### **Sybil Attacks**

These are much harder to Sybil attack as there is no time to prepare usually.

Thanks to that the rules are not as strict as for chain farming.

When you are setting up your farms, usually you **don't have to worry about bridging or connected addresses.**

### How is this different compared to the structured airdrops farms? 

The airdrops plays we focused in the previous lessons last for long months and they are very structured.

The ones we talk about this lesson are not structured at all. You just keep being an active DeFi user and try everything new you can. In most cases you won't know what actions will pay you.

**To make money** with this you **have to be active on a daily basis**. It's not enough to come back once a week like with the structured airdrops.

### **How to play this**

Even if you have little money you can be active on-chain (except of course on Ethereum chain).

Use new protocols on good cheap existing chains (Solana, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Base) that will gain attention in this bull market.

Start using/trying new protocols on new promising chains once they are released.  You have to be active in DeFi to spot these early on.

Make sure you make a few transactions even with low volume on these new protocols.

### How to play it after getting the tokens

Many of these projects can be early and might be a good idea to hold some of the tokens at least early on.

In general I always recommend to take at least 50% profit immediately after getting the airdrop.

### These opportunities change quickly

There will usually not be any Airdrop Step courses for these kinda opportunities since the window is very short. You fill find these in the ✍️ | daily-task-list channel.

This week you might be active on this chain then next week you will focus on another one.

These plays will be mostly talked about in experienced channels, so make sure you finish DeFi (Experienced) course.

### **Uniswap - Example #1**

In 2020 August Uniswap distributed tokens to every address that made at least one swap with their protocol.

It was worth $2000.

Of course you won't get money now for using Uniswap as it is a well-established and mature protocol.

### **Pyth on Solana - Example #2**

![[Pasted image 20240211001846.png]]

In 2023 November people who had used any protocols connected to Pyth got tokens airdropped on token launch.

It was worth low 4 figures depending on the exact activity.

Some active DeFi students made nice profits with this.

### **Memcoin on Solana - Example #3**

![[Pasted image 20240211001954.png]]

In 2023 November people who held $BONK (largest cap Solana coin) or were active on-chain got $PONK airdrop.

$PONK is just a random memecoin that might disappear soon BUT with this example you can see how random these plays can be. A new memecoin is released and you get 4 figures of worth free tokens if you were active on-chain.



#### Focus on newer networks and chain that havent yet seen a bull run like arb or base, not ethereum that already has

#### Cheap transactions are enough
