#### Don't:

- Be a robot machine, who mindlessly writes copy using only the templates he knowns, in only niche he knowns.
- Be like AI. Be adaptive and able to learn new things and change things when nessessary. Have a database that is constantly adding new things and taking old, outdated things to the side, just like how the market is always evolving and shifting shape

## How to achieve desired outcomes

1. What is my desired outcome?
2. What cause and effect chains will generate my outcome?
3. Create plan to test assumptions and achieve outcome
4. Take actions on plan and adjust based on real-time evaluation of results until outcome is achieved 

## How well you understand cause & effect will determine how successful you will are

The faster you can identify how your new environment "works" the faster you can use that info to get what you want


## If... Then...

- **If ** you push your body to failure with an exercise
- **Then** your brain will trigger  muscular adaptation

Most people are not aware/conscious about cause & effect and only use it subconsciously

So be as aware of it as possible about it in everything


## Multiple conditions for success

- **If** you push your body to failure with an exercise
- **And if** you have adequate protein
- **And if** you are in a calories surplus
- **Then** your body will grow the muscles used

## First Order Consequences VS Second Order Consequences VS Third Order Consequences 

Many times, the outcome you want are not the first order consequences

Also make sure the secondary consequences and beyond won't harm your objective

## Always think many steps ahead/ Know the chain of If... Thens to get to ultimate desired outcome

example:

Desire 1: Get client
Ultimate Desire: Get money from client

Desire 1:

Cause = need to make a good offer to, Effect: get client

So you tell a good offer but its too good offer and you can't actually provide it

Client leaves you on read




## When you arrive at new environment: There is a difference between How you think you know the environment Vs Reality

You watch all course videos of copywriting and thinks its easy, you know copywriting --> when inreality trying to write --> Didn't actually know nothing but theory


To transform your map to reality as fast as possible:

## Assumptions and unknowns need to be addressed

assumptions kill

identify assumptions --> test and validate those assumptions before executing
