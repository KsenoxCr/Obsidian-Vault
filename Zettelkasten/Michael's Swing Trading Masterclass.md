For breakout trading you should follow the bigger trend

If a single coin starts uptrending but the market as a whole is moving sideways, It's not likely a high probability setup

Best time to be in a long swing trade is when there is **hope**

When price is going up and everyones happy, Don't just think everyone's euphoric and its the top
## False False Breakout Box Method

 
Rule 1. **Trend Continuation**: trade must be in **Harmony with the Primary Trend** 

The whole market needs to have the trend

Rule 2. Strong breakout on 1D or higher timeframe

Rule 3. Box formation on lower timeframe

Rule 4. Wait for False breakout

Rule 5. Buy "unusual strength"



#### Backtesting:

-How much does whole market affect probability
-Wick vs single candle close vs proper beartrap for entry
-Do opposite side false breakouts matter
