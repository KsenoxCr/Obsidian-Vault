8/10. Wasted time in the morning before burpees by worrying about them and trying to push them further down the morning but it just made it worst. You just gotta do it, thats it. Used too much time making the calendar by simply being overwhelmed of the amount of work which isn't even that much. Need to use the tristan take method of not giving a fuck and having a war of how long can I stay calm or not. Other tasks went much better but in the times between did waste few minutes here and there googling worthless questions. 

Picked few niches and tomorrow will furtherly validate them. Barely scraped the new identity but will do it on a day when theres either no weight training or school. Going to sleep was yet again stretched too far by my poor but improving understanding of time.
