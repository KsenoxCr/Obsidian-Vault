7/10. Focus wasnt the createst and same morning pattern happened. was faster but still didnt have speed waking after waking up. And spend school time slackinh waiting it to be over like i was opting in and out instead of constantly pushing forward

Didnt have zero tolerance on degenerate behavior, standards lowered, wanked, lower focus and more mind wandering

Spend 30min on a message overanalysing it that cou√∂d have been writted in 5

NEED TO TAKE BREAKS to bring back focus and work more overtime

Got airdrop dailytasks done but not 100% efficiently

Use Timers For G Work Sessions (no time to worry that way)
