6/10. Not really a productive day but that was coming cause the yesterdays fuck up. 
Didnt do all school stuff. 
Wasted so time getting used to vr. Didnt eat much at daytime so was shaking at the gym. Multitasked poorly when helping cousin with airdrop farm.

Still trained okay. And got some backtests done even tho lost focus few times.
