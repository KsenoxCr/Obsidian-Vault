Most people don’t know shit what their talking about

#1 opinion is ALWAYS the **chart**

Even if there is a billionaire macro investor saying: ”X coin is bullish!”

-He’s just one person and he can’t move the market


Twitter/reddit/some opinions are NOT OBJECTIVE. **everybody has an opinion** on the market

When reading twitter threads for info, keep in mind to not just consume without absorbing knowledge

No own opinion - be here in the middle - dont listen to anybody 


Trades need to be done with STRONG OPINIONS

but…

need to have **strong** **opinion** but **weakly held**
