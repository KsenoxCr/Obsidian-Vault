7.5/10. 

Okay day but didnt code or do all 25 backtest (only) spent evening

I see a pattern where the longer the day has gone and less hours left, the more productive I become. So I need to find ways to trick my mind into thinking that I can stop the day and go to sleep earlier. Like the marathon runner who said to herself that she can take her gloves of on the next mile, every mile of the race. 

Need to be more mindfull and aware of time consumption, like how much each task takes time and could I improve it. Also sometimes taking a small "unproductive" thinking break could make things faster as you come up with a new better strategy/system for doing that repetive task.

Be the observer of your thoughs. I start to realize more and more how much I can control my thoughs. When a though occurs, instead of listening to it as absolute truth, question it and think it from different perspectives. Also remember that no matter how bad the thought or feeling is, you will forget it sooner than you think. 

Try to make it a habit that always when deciding something which aint a nanodecision, listly quickly the pros and cons of the different options. Build the gut feeling by doing what it says cause usually when your mind isnt thinking critically, your gut is.    

And make it a habit to think every action you are about to take: if it is worth your time and standards or not. It makes a huge difference in the long game. And instead of jumping in blindly, always observe, orient and think how you can be optimal. Yeah it is more effort and brain calories but it will make you better at everything. 

Practice the art of not giving a fuck and going with the flow. Be like water my friend
