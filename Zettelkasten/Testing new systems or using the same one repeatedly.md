Don't have more than two trades open at the same time with the same system

If you'd use same trading system on i.e 7 coins, you would:
- Have 7R risk
- If one looses -> highly likely others are also gonna loose
- Have to manage 7 position at the same time (unnesessary difficulty)


**In stocks**, you can diversify by owning different assets, because the market sectors are clear and the market it self is hundreds of years old 

**In crypto**, owning multiple different assets ain't really diversifying because if btc crumbles, so does everything else


To diversify your trades, use different types of trading systems
