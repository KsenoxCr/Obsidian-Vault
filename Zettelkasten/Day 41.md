9/10. Overall pretty great day. Focused on school work well. At the end though looked at pics of escorts for to see about 30min which im definitely not proud of and it was a waste of time. Realised the whole time I was coping. But DIDNT FAP which is great. a tiny win in the tale of victorious war of conquering myself. 

Did burpees at night even tho I should have done them at morning. Made an excuse that I doesn't matter at what time I do them. 

Saw friend as i sold him my products and was kinda my old self when talking to him it was gonna happen as I haven't been used to speaking to him like I speak to others. 

Fucked up the timing to go to H&M so went to new yorker instead. NEED to get better at understanding time. Right now main problem with managint 

The change in behaviour came from agoge program and the identity change that I want to make. I want to be the greatest version of my self and sexual addiction is in mountain I now need to climb on the side. I want a healthy sex life and not use it as method of escapism of problems. Instead use my sexual energy as in a positive way and transmute it into work and creativity to achieve greatness and excelence

If I keep positive mindset no matter what happens and how I fail in things and realize that I'm a human who constantly makes small mistakes but is trying to be as sharp as humanly possible and tries his best --> I will win the battles ahead. Always when I believe in my self and don't care about emotions like fear, pain, 

Instead of thinking: "Ah another word that I don't know :("

Think: "Uh, another new word to learn or master"
