Stop thinking about how much time you have

Instead focus on how much can you achieve today, now in this current task


Andrew's example exercise:

"Raise your hand as high as you can"

"Okay, now raise it even higher"

"Now raise it to it's maximum capacity"


As you can see, you **could do much** more than you thought you could do.
