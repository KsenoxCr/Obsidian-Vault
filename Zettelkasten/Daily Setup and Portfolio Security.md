### **Security Setup to Avoid Scams**

Use laptop only for interacting with any crypto platform. Doesn’t matter if it’s centralized exchanges or some DeFi app you should always use a computer not a mobile. Laptop is way more convenient than computer because it’s portable.

IF you are on the way and only have phone then use that for learning or chatting in TRW.

To be able to do crypto properly we also highly recommend a large monitor. You will work much faster that way.

### **Basic Computer Security**

You will see a list are the most common practices/mistakes that you should pay attention to for your basic setup.

With being careful you will be able to avoid most of the attacks as you won't be an easy target.

### Basic Computer Security II

- Don’t leave your computer unlocked ‎  When you leave your computer, make sure to lock it. If you leave for longer then turn off your laptop.
- Don’t let anyone touch your devices .‎ Don't let friends or family members let alone anyone else touch your work computer or phone. They could accidentally click on some random links or download a malware.
- Only download programs from official website ‎ Avoid untrustworthy downloads for well known software.
- Always use the official website. Also don't download random software for no reason.
- Don’t share personal info unless necessary ‎ Many programs ask for you personal info for different reasons. If it’s not crucial for the usage of the service then do NOT provide your personal info.

### **Basic Computer Security III**

- Don’t click on shady links ‎ By clicking on random links you could accidentally download some malware. If you really have to click on something that looks fishy then use a secondary device. 
- Do NOT connect to public WIFI ‎ Don't connect to public to WIFI from your work computer or phone. Only use your phone data. If you need to use internet on your laptop then connect to your phone's hotspot.
- Use VPN. ‎ With VPN no one can see what you do online with your computer. With VPN you can also bypass restrictions abroad by switching your location in the app. Use NordVPN or ProtonVPN. ‎
- Passwords ‎ Always use strong passwords that are hard to guess and don’t use the same password everywhere. You can also use password managers but do NOT forget your master password. ‎ Don’t keep any passwords unencrypted on your computer. If you write them down on paper make sure you don't lose them.

### **Basic computer security IV**

- Log out from services and change your passwords from time to time.
- Use trusted browsers that work well with crypto wallets. We recommend Google Chrome or Brave. 
- Emails ‎
   - Use well known email providers (gmail)
   - Use private email service if you need privacy
   - Ignore unsolicited emails
   - Don’t open random attachments
   - Use strong password as your email is connected to most of your other logins
   - Use separate personal and work emails
- Never ever use your work email for personal use. Also don’t sign up for spams, coupons, lists, etc from your main or work email.
### **Basic computer security V**

- Get software updates ‎ As new exploits are discovered new software patches are deployed to fix the vulnerabilities. If you update your software you can make sure that those exploits don’t happen to you. Enable auto-update features in your OS. ‎ - - Back up the data.  ‎ If you have important data on your computer then make sure you back it up. If it’s sensitive then encrypt it. Use a mix of cloud (dropbox, box, etc) and hardware solutions (USB drive, external hard drive).
- Encrypt your devices. ‎If you encrypt your devices then without the encryption password others can't access and read your data.
- Use anti-malware software. ‎ By using anti-malware you can get rid of most of the malware but it's not a magic solution. Check which one is the best for your device. Erasing your laptop from time to time is the cleanest solution. ‎ Erase all data and factory reset OS from time to time ‎ To make sure you get rid of all malware you gotta wipe out your hard drive completely. Only after that you should reinstall your operating system.

### **How to avoid scams**

With a few easy steps you can protect yourself from most of the scams. ‎ Although centralized exchanges and decentralized apps have some common dangers, many of the pitfalls are different so you will see separated lists.

### Centralized Exchange Checklist

- Hold money only on recommended exchanges . ‎Only use recommended exchanges. Small/new exchanges could be scams or could have liquidity issues. ‎ - - Enable 2FA ‎ Two-factor authentication is there to protect you from most of the attacks. Make sure you use Google Authenticator app not SMS.
- DO NOT give your password to anyone. ‎ Don’t trust anyone with your password. From time to time also update your password.
- Make sure you use the correct web/mobile app ‎ You might think you are using Binance for instance but it might be a fake exchange with a similar address.
- You should also make sure you don't access an account with a large amount on it from mobile.
- DO NOT fall for phishing emails ‎ Scammers will ask you to take some action to secure your account. They might ask you to update your account info or reset your password. Usually they wanna collect your login credentials to try and hack your account.
- Keep most of your money OFF exchanges ‎ They can decide to freeze your money at any moment. They have control over your wallet and they have the seed phrase. Only keep as much money on exchanges as you need for trading.
### **Decentralized Apps (On-Chain) Checklist**

To be scammed on a decentralized app the scammers have to get access to your funds that you control with your wallet like Metamask.
‎
- NEVER give out your seed phrase
‎- The only time you will need your seed phrase is when you create a new instance or you wanna do a seed phrase recovery on a device. This happens through the wallet interface. Never give your seed phrase to any other app.
‎- If you expose the seed phrase the scammer will have access do every single address within that wallet account.
‎- Use a hardware wallet if you have money to protect. Hardware wallets provide you an extra layer of security. They won't protect you from everything though. If you sign a malicious transaction with your hardware wallet you still gave access to scammers.
- **DO NOT engage with DM’s**. Whenever you get a DM on Discord or Telegram you should assume it’s a scam. **Projects will never DM you**.

### **Decentralized Apps (On-Chain) Checklist II**

‎- DO NOT click on random links. Scammers will send you links with some juicy deals. The attack vector can vary but they always wanna gain access to your wallet at some point.
‎- Make sure you use the correct web address
‎- You might think you are using Uniswap for instance but it might be a fake app with a similar web address that looks the same.
‎- DO NOT connect your wallet to random web apps. If you find an interesting new/unknown project always check its validity first. If you decide to interact with it make sure you use a wallet with little money in it.
‎- Use a burner wallet for new/unknown apps. If you wanna mint an NFT on a random site or wanna interact with a DeFi app then use a wallet that only has as much money in it as much covers the interaction.
‎- Make sure you know what transaction you sign. Even if you clicked on a random link or connected to a fake site it's not too late if you don't give them access to your wallet by signing a transaction. Once you sign a malicious transaction there is no way back.
