This week was better than weeks before. Still there is so fucking much improvement. On mornings I waste so much time on ”waking up” I dont straight up jump out of bed and when I do My movements are slow

I have waken up late so school work is always late and am not on live calls. Also focus too much on the day ahead so the programming itself suffers from that. 

Have a bad habit of coming up with questions in my mind and immediately on impulse google them. Instead I have to either think about it for myself for atleas 15 sec and if its that important, google it. NO Impulse tasks

Have been using gratefulness to power my days and to work harder and do the hard things. need to use it even more often

Wasted almost a month watching copywriting lessons and doing little actual work and when it was time to work I pussied out on agoge program as it was ”too hard”. How do i think i can win in anything if i quit when its little difficult

I acknowlwdge that the change of plan comes from my ground level confidence in copywriting. 

At some point with everything there are gonna be points when you are lost and overwhelmed —> not confident but you just gotta push through there no way around it

If i now come up with proof that I’m better at programming than copywriting, the choice was right:

### Programming 

#### Good

- Working mainly in the back ground
- Not relying on selling anything
- One dimentional/ no multitasks
- Can focus on one thing and become extraordinary in it
- Remote

#### Bad

- Less money to be made in the short term/cant leverage, 
- Hard to make projects alone
- 9-5 till savings gathered


### Copywriting

#### Good

- More money in short term
- Projects take less time
- Can be done few hours a day
- Remote
#### Bad

- For me harder to master
- Need lot of emphaty/ understand people deeply
- Many task work
- Every project is different
