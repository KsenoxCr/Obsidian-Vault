**Everyone** has their winner and loser voice

The Man and the pussy voice


## You need to suppress and eliminate your pussy voice

When ever it pop ups, you can:

- Laugh at it just like it’s another weak minded individual trying to influence you
- Shout at it (in your mind ofc)
- suppress its energy so it becames a empty shell (?)

## When gotten rid of these negative ideas, time to replace them with something positive

As copywriter you know:

Words, spoken or internal, are extemely POWERFUL

## Pains work as motivation but you need a desire to get somewhere 


If you just look at the pain, you are running backwards and not sure where you are going

# Focus on:

## gratitute

gratitute removes the feeling of threat

## Beaty

beautiful things in life


## Purpose 

You are here to please god and worship him. Show him how beautiful and great his creation is


## Feeling of love for others

When in war, soldiers keep fighting for their families and brothers in the trenches

## Power

Think about power, how you wanna feel it, have it, spread 


# How to construct your thoughts


# 1. Who you are

Who you believe you are determines you actually are


”I am (insert who do you want to be) 

I am Akseli Muhonen and I will always find a way to win

## 2. What you want to do

I do (insert action)



If you can, say these out loud

Dont just think about them but THINK about it

Shout in your brain 

## 3. The more I do, the more I get

The more (insert hard task) I do, the more (insert powerful achievement)

## Visualizations / Mental images as also really powerful and useful

# Really important: Start your day with powerful self-talk 


Most people, as soon as they wake up, start scrolling and let external forces control their thoughts.

You need to control them always when conscious 


Start this momentum and keep it going through the day by immediately destroying negative, weak thoughts  
Make all this a habit and you’ll get better at it
