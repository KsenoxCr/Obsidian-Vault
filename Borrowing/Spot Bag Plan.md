## ETH

#### Pullback --> Swap to USDT (new )

Lending split:

-Aave (12,5%)



After bottom:

1. Lend ETH to AAVE as collateral
2. Borrow USDT With low leverage (allow for 30% pullback without liquidation)
3. Buy more ETH with that USDT

At the top of bullrun (Profs confirmation)

1. Sell ETH to USDT 
2. Repay USDT debt
3. Withdraw collateral
4. Sell ETH to USDT


UNKNOWNS:

- LTV
- Liquidation threshold
- lending yield
- borrowing interest rate
- confirmed top & bottom

ASSUMPTIONS:

- I can swap and sell ETH to USDT when I want to
- smaller than 30% pullback
- Can identify top & bottom at right time

## Layer 2s

When profs announce possible on bottom on $BTC

2. ARB
3. Metis

Okay. I have total of 1,5 ETH which is 50% of my total spot bags and I calculated that for 3 months I would get around $850 =  1,5 ETH * 120 days * estimated price of $0,15 (at whale market it's at $0,30). Could be lower or higher, we'll see.
